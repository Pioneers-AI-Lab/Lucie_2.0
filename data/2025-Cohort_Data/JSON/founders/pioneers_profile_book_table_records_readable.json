      "What I am interested in working on:": "Problem I'm currently working on solving: Young borrowers under 30 face systematic barriers within European credit scoring systems that stem from the fundamental design of traditional risk assessment methodologies. The emphasis on historical credit performance and established financial relationships inherently disadvantages individuals who have had limited time to develop comprehensive credit histories or accumulate substantial assets that serve as collateral or demonstrate financial stability.\n\nWith major players such as Schufa Holding AG, Experian, and other commercial listed companies controlling significant portions of European credit information systems, young borrowers who have primarily engaged with alternative financial services or maintained minimal traditional banking relationships may find their creditworthiness inadequately represented in standard assessment processes.\n\nSolution: Behavioral credit scoring represents a paradigm shift in financial risk assessment, leveraging non-traditional data sources to evaluate creditworthiness. This approach analyzes patterns in digital transactions, social media interactions, mobile usage, and other behavioral indicators to complement or replace traditional metrics like payment history and debt-to-income ratios. In Europe, where 22% of adults lack access to traditional credit products, behavioral scoring offers potential solutions for financial inclusion while introducing complex regulatory considerations under evolving EU frameworks.",

Since then, I’ve worked closely with early-stage founders across Europe as a CXO and now scout promising startups for VCs and angels.\r\n\r\nI’m now looking for a co-founder, someone with vision, grit, and the hunger to build something from zero. Not just to join a venture, but to shape it. Someone who’s ready to move fast, solve real problems, and stay resilient when it gets hard. I’m not looking for an employee. I’m looking for a true partner. If that sounds like you, I’d love to talk.",

I was CTO and I coded the entire stack: the AI agent, the backend, the frontend and the associated infrastructure. \r\nIn just a couple of months, we had a functional SEO AI agent, our first paying e‑commerce customers and a pre‑seed term sheet from a venture capital fund. \r\nBefore we signed it however, my co‑founder decided to step back for personal reasons.\r\nRight now I am looking to find the right co-founder to go all-in on a startup idea.

      "What I am interested in working on:": "What drives me to start a new venture comes down to three key factors: (1) working on a product or service I truly believe in, (2) targeting a large and scalable market opportunity, and (3) building alongside a co-founder and team that inspire me.\n\nWith that mindset, I’m now launching an ambitious deep tech venture in the humanoid robotics space. I believe strongly in the “brownfield” concept—where human-form robots, powered by advanced AI, can integrate into existing environments and have a transformative impact. As a platform technology, humanoid robotics presents vast entrepreneurial potential. It can play a critical role in re-industrializing Europe and addressing structural challenges such as labor shortages in aging societies, as well as strengthening defense and technological sovereignty.\n\nThe timing is right for a generational opportunity: to build foundational infrastructure for the future—rooted in Europe, serving the world.",

I like to build companies where people play a big role. I can embark teams and partners onto entrepreneurial journeys.\n\nI live in Paris, am married and have 3 children.",

I’m especially interested in building scalable tools and platforms that help robotics companies deploy autonomy faster, from SLAM/perception to motion planning. I’m also excited about AI agents that bridge the gap between physical systems and human interfaces, especially where multimodal intelligence (vision + language) can unlock real-world automation.",
      "Introduction:": "I’m a founder and engineer passionate about robotics, AI, and building real-world autonomous systems. I started my entrepreneurial journey by building a solo startup that simplified bank account opening using face recognition and document processing with computer vision, which was later acquired by a local bank.\n\nSince then, I have co-founded two deeptech startups. At QSpot, we’re developing an AI agent that autonomously manages parking lots by combining computer vision and large language models. Currently, I’m focused on Neuronav, a cloud-based SLAM and localization platform designed to help robotics startups and mid-sized companies reduce development time by 6 to 8 months and cut costs by 100x.\n\nMy technical background spans over five years of hands-on experience working with Linux, C++, Python, Rust, ROS, FastAPI, and Docker. I have a strong foundation in robotics perception, motion planning, and infrastructure development. Additionally, I’ve conducted research in activity recognition outside of robotics, giving me a broad perspective on applying machine learning to real-world problems.",

      "What I am interested in working on:": "- Build a product leveraging LLM (only interested in this)\n- Play to my unique strengths - leveraging big data, traditional AI/ML and LLMs\n- Keen on building for strategy consultation.

      "Introduction:": " I’m Adhityan. Born in India, now based in Paris (my 5th country after stints in Singapore, Dubai, and briefly the US). My journey started early: I wrote my first lines of C++ at 8, and by 11, I was interning at my first startup — debugging, shipping, and falling in love with building. That love never left.\n\nOver the years, I’ve built and scaled products and tech teams from scratch, wearing every startup hat — from writing backend code to pitching investors. I’m a technical founder at heart, with deep expertise in distributed systems and high-throughput platforms. I can code 0 to 1, and scale processes and teams from 1 to 100.\n\nI have a hustler–builder bias. While I’ve done pre-sales, led teams, shipped code, hired and fired, and handled operations, tech, and business strategy - I am at my best building products. I believe in fast iterations, staying uncomfortable, and surrounding myself with people who raise the bar.\n\nPS:\nWhile I have led and can do web app development, understand and build mobile apps - my current strengths are in building data platforms, web services (backend), infra setup and automation, designing scalable architectures and multiple clouds. \n\nI am very impact driven. I plan to aim high, build something of value for others while generating value for myself. I have had the most joy when others tell me they love what I have built and this motivates me.",

      "Introduction:": "Think retired Counter‑Strike competitor meets stage‑ready storyteller who can chat to a crowd of 2 000.\r\n\r\nI like to see myself as a tech \"couteau-suisse\".  I've built my experience to draw a thin line between deep tech knowledge and the ability to translate business into requirements. \r\n\r\nAt 15, I've built my first company : an e-sport team with a community agency. (That's where the \"Counter-strike competitor\" comes from).\r\n\r\nDuring my studies, I've became president of the Junior-Entreprise (consulting association) of my engineering school, and then became CTO of the french confederation of Junior-Entreprise. (20k end users, 100k budget, and I've been multiple time speaker in front of >1.5 people). \r\n\r\nWorked at the most important energy company of the country. Horrible experience, but learned quite a bit. \r\n\r\nThen joined Sparkmate, a start-up studio that aims to ship company in 5 weeks, whatever the subject. Worked on an AI-powered ERP for top insurance company, a children story telling box powered by AI (start-up raised > 10M), a bus that recharges while moving, fencing shoes.  \r\n\r\nThen I became sick. \r\n\r\nRecovered, then left the company. Built my own one. Failed it. (hopefully, what an experience it was!). Now, ready.",
