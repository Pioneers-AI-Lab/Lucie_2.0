      "interested_in_working_on": "Problem I'm currently working on solving: Young borrowers under 30 face systematic barriers within European credit scoring systems that stem from the fundamental design of traditional risk assessment methodologies. The emphasis on historical credit performance and established financial relationships inherently disadvantages individuals who have had limited time to develop comprehensive credit histories or accumulate substantial assets that serve as collateral or demonstrate financial stability.\n\nWith major players such as Schufa Holding AG, Experian, and other commercial listed companies controlling significant portions of European credit information systems, young borrowers who have primarily engaged with alternative financial services or maintained minimal traditional banking relationships may find their creditworthiness inadequately represented in standard assessment processes.\n\nSolution: Behavioral credit scoring represents a paradigm shift in financial risk assessment, leveraging non-traditional data sources to evaluate creditworthiness. This approach analyzes patterns in digital transactions, social media interactions, mobile usage, and other behavioral indicators to complement or replace traditional metrics like payment history and debt-to-income ratios. In Europe, where 22% of adults lack access to traditional credit products, behavioral scoring offers potential solutions for financial inclusion while introducing complex regulatory considerations under evolving EU frameworks.",

      "introduction": " I’m Adhityan. Born in India, now based in Paris (my 5th country after stints in Singapore, Dubai, and briefly the US). My journey started early: I wrote my first lines of C++ at 8, and by 11, I was interning at my first startup — debugging, shipping, and falling in love with building. That love never left.\n\nOver the years, I’ve built and scaled products and tech teams from scratch, wearing every startup hat — from writing backend code to pitching investors. I’m a technical founder at heart, with deep expertise in distributed systems and high-throughput platforms. I can code 0 to 1, and scale processes and teams from 1 to 100.\n\nI have a hustler–builder bias. While I’ve done pre-sales, led teams, shipped code, hired and fired, and handled operations, tech, and business strategy - I am at my best building products. I believe in fast iterations, staying uncomfortable, and surrounding myself with people who raise the bar.\n\nPS:\nWhile I have led and can do web app development, understand and build mobile apps - my current strengths are in building data platforms, web services (backend), infra setup and automation, designing scalable architectures and multiple clouds. \n\nI am very impact driven. I plan to aim high, build something of value for others while generating value for myself. I have had the most joy when others tell me they love what I have built and this motivates me.",
