@channel 

FYI:  Freelancers, early-stage solo founders, creators, indie developers, who pay for tools from their own money are NOT considered B2B customers. They are Prosumers. A B2B Customer considered for full LOI points should pay from company expenses (have cashflow) and have at least 1 Full-time employee.

Warning: :warning: We will deduct points for incomplete or poor task completions.

An LOI must have a digital or physical signature. Emails are not accepted!

a user interview should be an actual conversation with a potential user. Submission should be a recap of that conversation with key learnings!

An annoying investor needs you to show up right now. The investor shows no mercy and requires you to give an update right away.
That being said. Instead of 12:20, you now only have until 12:10 to submit.
Any submissions after 12:10 are not counted and lead to disqualification.
Good luck!!

It’s Decision Time!!!
This was very hard decision to make as we’ve been working alongside you for a long time and have developed affinities with each team. Also, we can make mistakes – companies we’ve rejected in the past have gone to be great companies!
So….. After careful evaluation and deliberations with Hugo and the Pioneers team, the following startups have been selected for the Investment Committee:
Umamy
Mirmi
JooobAI
AvaHome
FitBot
GovIntel
A reminder of the Selection criteria (in order of importance):
Execution – GTM traction and product progress
Team – background, cohesion, and founder-product fit
Market – size and potential
 What’s next:
Office Hours: For the teams not moving forward, we’re hosting a feedback session starting at 3pm at the Hogwarts Room next to our space. Please text @Niklas - Pioneers Team  to book your slot.
We do realise that some teams are too early in their adventure and need a bit more time (August timing wasn’t great): we are forecasting to host one more IC in about a month – if you show traction, reach out to us. Any team in the sprint phase is eligible.
Post-IC For those not advancing: you may stay at Station F until the end of November, but since you’re not officially in the program anymore, you would need to cover the cost your seat (€259 + VAT/month/per seat). You all may stay at the Pioneers space until Monday without additional cost.
And ofcourse: you are now part of the Pioneers alumni community meaning you will be invited to our events, workshops and will be fasttracked for consideration for future cohorts :muscle:
Now it’s time for the remaining teams to rock it during the IC this Friday, let’s go!!!!


Hugo's follow-on message: 

Hey Everyone,
I just want to take a moment to say how proud you can be of what you’ve accomplished so far. Whether you’re moving forward to the IC or not, this is just one step in a much longer journey.
As far as I know, building a company is a marathon with many ups and downs; today’s decision doesn’t define your future. What matters is the grit, creativity, and persistence you bring to the adventure. Keep pushing, keep learning, and remember that every milestone (even the tough ones) is part of building something truly meaningful.
We’re rooting for all of you!

Selection Day Information
Here’s everything you need to know about Selection Day, happening next Wednesday at 4pm:
Selection Day is the first filter of the program. The main goal of this milestone is to:
1. make sure you are in a team
2. make sure you're on the right track
:jigsaw: Selection Criteria:
Team & Idea – You have locked your team & are fixed on your problem space.
Progress made – You have shown progress: clear user feedback, signs of traction or market interest.
Ambition & vision – Here we make sure the size of your ambition aligns with ours :)
MOAT - You understand what your differentiating factor is.
For solofounders who've decided to pursue the lonely path - we will evaluate your progress as well.
The following Friday we shall announce those who have passed the selection. Good luck!
:date: Format:
Each team will pitch in front of the investment committee.
Format: 3 min pitch + 5 min Q&A.
Your pitch should clearly cover: problem, solution, market, traction (or strong signals), team, and roadmap.
Each team will be assigned a slot and will only join the session on their slot.
It is possible to pitch remotely
-> This is the culmination of 8 weeks of work. Be sharp, be bold, and show us why you’re the right team for this problem.","Program Week":"Week 7"}},{"id":"rec45976shgSRfcRZ","createdTime":"2025-09-02T11:35:58.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Office Hours - Sprint (Mo-Wed, 15 min per team)","Date":"2025-08-05T09:00:00.000Z","Type of session":["Office hours Pioneers"],"Program Week":"Week 9 - Sprint Channel"}},{"id":"rec4T3J3VByHB8U5e","createdTime":"2025-09-02T10:24:46.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Selection Day - Result Announcement (+ OH + beer same day)","Attachments":[{"id":"att0qzT6MwRq3Btqq","width":720,"height":706,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768248000000/cAOMw4LX4wga9ToTNh4HHw/H4vKEagiAIbk5nOt_t3KcQ1y4V8qivJ8lloW9PeSiV6uGKXtPyEp8HYknK5NZYH7lTiu4v55aHz9Sl74uAXryo0-FjuT43dQJ2lOisxTCaYqa_RYG8JiDLtJ0gyI1GSdm4rujQmh3psvIEd91E5aVQ/dEnXrNFN22U2mKDW8Z5hVDrjOYN8GABlKFeD5iW-qzQ","filename":"image.png","size":101612,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768248000000/diaOEr8_LG5-8pz_FdK3gg/O56E-WH5jCBFXlMQqHZHBuBPjdrwp-TGBtku94iKXrXLi7qziJ084TqaECQmjgMEje5v0A5M2B0RnmEuOpZo5WIpFRp8h-joNVW37nbJhtokX0rRwzXG9M7hb03j2yvykz6J1np0iVFGUMkI_iL4LA/GEO_SeRMH_W37-lETNGpW4S7zeMGg57F8v2xv1doBsM","width":37,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768248000000/tIZJnq7jvrOQ51QHKNSlaQ/y5sO_lRbe4tNmZIELZQlKVEyoittfdezFAyOjJJK27SiuqadddRMT4_hnyGwwdnDyKUMufh70qSKTTzuVIlxd5WTh2WfDYVK-UtDAoYLFxA5Nv8GrF9pOZ_0n_dAhqosKSCn5uMA3mXQOmyMJhSggA/kaKA79_iPGRoiiYTSBjRvSWtpP8dyK1t0pAiEtC9npg","width":522,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768248000000/fsOh1pZTElcKTwRO6YLmGA/MWPfswCXpTB6HGGZnsYIA3Ople3ipz_uOWsbAjGA01w8TGAtySM763RVhl0PKAcBH0zn7apNDJZGhqvPiydELVc-Q2X5ilc0YrsdfIpBYGo7tfRGakrAYLJDmEhfjFMUGcAt-F_SnQuqBwHDHB2G6w/7W-r9h2DybgV5AtNAI5-iJdRakK2SD5qA-r71Cs_bEQ","width":720,"height":706}}}],"Date":"2025-07-31T14:00:00.000Z","Type of session":["Announce/Organisation"],"Slack Instruction & Email Commu":"Hello Pioneers, the moment has come. @channel
First off, thank you for your commitment and effort over the past six weeks. You all deserve a lot of credit. Evaluating your progress wasn’t easy. We faced several edge cases, and early-stage investing is, by definition, shaped by subjective judgment.
A note to those not selected:
Don’t let this stop you, keep building. We’re fully aware that we can make mistakes. Also, some of the best founders I backed at Hook had pitched to us multiple times before getting an investment. You remain part of the Pioneers community and and we’ll be keeping an eye on your progress.
To the selected teams:
This is far from a win. You’ve cleared a checkpoint but there’s still a long way to go to be investment-ready for the IC. There were no clear yes and you’ll all need to seriously accelerate execution and focus on validating core assumptions.
Next steps:
:date: Office Hours – Tomorrow, 11:00–13:00
We’ll be available tomorrow to answer questions. Feel free to ask about the decision-making, and share your honest feedback with us to help us improve.

For those not continuing in the sprint phase, we’ll outboard you on Tuesday. You can always come back for a meeting, and we will send you an invite.
:beers:For tonight
Let’s celebrate the past weeks together over drinks - you’ve earned it!
:speech_balloon: Slack & alumni community:
For those not selected, you remain part of the Pioneers community and we will invite you to events in the next months (stay tuned for a get-together after IC in September with the batch + friends).
Please also stay active with us on Slack, and let us know whenever the community can support you. Thank you again for your dedication and openness throughout this journey so far.

Exercise: The Worst Startup Idea
Goal:
 Come up with the most ridiculously bad startup idea you can think of — and pitch it like it’s the next unicorn.
How It Works
Your Mission
As a team, create and pitch the worst startup idea possible — one that is:
Incredibly niche or solves a non-problem (e.g. throw AI at everything - solution in search of a problem)
Technically or ethically flawed
Completely unscalable
Prep Time
Use this time to brainstorm and prepare a 3-4 minute pitch . Think of:
Name & tagline
Problem Slide
Solution Slide
Business Model
Target Market with Market Size
GTM Strategy / Timeline
Optional: Fundraising
Team
Pitch Time (3-4 min per group)
Each group pitches their horrible idea with full confidence — as if they truly believe in it
Voting
After all pitches, everyone votes for:
Worst Startup Idea
Most Convincing Pitch for a Bad Idea
Best Team Name","Program Week":"Week 1"}},{"id":"recHvtzIQvhAFXrtI","createdTime":"2025-09-02T11:27:00.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Friday Pitches - Salomon Announcement","Date":"2025-08-26T09:30:00.000Z","Type of session":["Announce/Organisation"],"Slack Instruction & Email Commu":":mega: Friday Pitches with Hugo & Salomon – Important Milestone

 Pick an industry you're interested in. Build a value prop (e.g. a landing page with signup option, a newsletter, an advertisement, or a social media post). This is your smoke screen. Once you have set this up, you try to collect waitlist signups.
:magnet: Step 2 – Drive Your First Traffic
 Once your page is live, find the fastest way to market it and get your first 5+ signups. Some quick-win channels:
Product Hunt Ship, Reddit, Facebook groups, IndieHackers, in person sign ups or any other creative way
:memo: Submit by 5:45 in #submissions
Create a Google Doc with:
Project name, team members, and a 1-liner
Website link
Tool used to build the page (Webflow, Lovable, Wordpress etc.)
What channels you used to get subscribers
Number of users reached
Numbers of \"sign-ups\"

Hello Batch – hope your week is off to a strong start.
Reminder: this week’s theme is Distribution.
AI made building easy, now the hard part is reach.
If you can’t get your product in front of the right people, it doesn’t matter how good it is.
So either:
Your product solves such a deep pain that cold outreach converts unusually well,
or
You’ll need to think way outside the box to crack your distribution.
Keep testing. Keep shipping.

Double AWS Session This Friday :fire:
Hey @channel,
As mentioned earlier, we have an AWS session this Friday from 3–4 PM in the AWS Room (Share Zone). But since we already have our own AWS expert @Connor Blair here, we’re turning it into a double session!
Here’s the plan:
2:30–2:55 PM — AWS Perspective with Connor
We'll kick things off in the Nebuchadnezzar Room (right in front of the Pioneers space), where Connor will briefly walk you through the key AWS points and answer questions from an independent expert’s perspective.
3:00–4:00 PM — AWS Session
Then we move over to the AWS Room (Share Zone) for a short presentation and open Q&A with two AWS engineers. A great chance to ask questions - maybe even the same ones again and compare the answers from the “more biased” AWS side.
We encourage critical questions - cloud infra is often one of the backbones of your startup and AWS wants to sell to you.
TL;DR:
Friday, June 11
2:30–3:00 PM: Nebuchadnezzar Room – AWS with @Connor Blair
3:00–4:00 PM: AWS Room (Share Zone) – AWS engineer presentation + Q&A
Both events are in the calendar. Looking forward to a full-circle session from both an independent expert and AWS itself!

We’re in sprint phase - which means moving fast, iterating quickly, and getting things out the door.

Stéphane shares his top frameworks and real-life examples from Lovable and other ventures to show how you can accelerate your build process.

Hi Pioneers,

First of all, thank you for the past weeks. This was an intensive time, and we highly appreciate your contribution to the program and your drive to build!

As you are not moving to the sprint phase, we ask you to help us shape the next cohort with the exit form.

This isn’t a formality! 
Your input directly helps us improve from how we structure the program to how we select, support, and challenge future founders. It also helps us figure out how we can continue to support you: with intros, guidance, or future opportunities.

It should only take a few minutes:

This Week’s Theme is: Pivoting
Either your idea got validated, meaning real people were willing to try or even pay for it, or… it didn’t.
If you got traction:
Double down. Take your learnings and optimize your positioning:
Sharpen who your ideal customer is
Refine your messaging and value proposition
Improve onboarding or UX for better conversion
Push toward more proof (repeat usage, new users, or actual payments)
If you didn’t get traction:
That’s totally fine, most don’t. You now need to pivot, and the faster, the better.
Your options:
Hard Pivot (changing the core of the business):
New customer segment
New core problem
New solution or product
Entirely new market
Soft Pivot (same direction, but refined):
Reframing the value prop, narrowing or expanding the user persona
Reworking the channel or go-to-market
Changing the feature focus
Whatever path you’re on, this week is about building clarity and making bold, informed moves.

Get on as many calls as possible. Talk to real people and uncover real problems. Do not pitch ideas or solutions—just listen and learn. Use the #ask-for-intros channel.
:brain: How?
Pick a problem space (we assigned one to you - but you can also change it if your team agrees to it)
Reach out to people, get them on the phone. Use the Mom Test approach to ask better questions and get useful insights.
:phone: The more you're on the phone, the better. Ideally call together as a group.
:memo: Submit a Google Doc by 5:45pm
What you have to submit:
What methodology used to get leads (bullet points only)
Total leads contacted (Name, position, contact)
Total calls booked or taken
Key learnings (if you manage to get on calls)
