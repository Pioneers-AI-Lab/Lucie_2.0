TEAM:
The 2 founders (Zack and Jules) have complementary personalities and are very aligned in their vision and way of working. 
They also present well and are outspoken. 
Zac has strong experience with Blue-collar workers in his previous experience. (he's the ex-COO of Bold, and founder of La Tournée)

EXECUTION:
During the program they showed a good capacity to question themselves and their positioning. (They have pivoted on their solution 3-4 times)
Within the program: they closed a design partnership with a big interim company with a annual contract value of 25k EUR.

CONS:

TEAM:
Lost 2 CTO -cofounders during the program, which is an ""orange"" flag in their capacity to attract and keep strong talent.

EXECUTION:
Pivoted too many times which shows a lack of market clarity which resulted in not shipping any product during the program.

MARKET:
Their new positioning (Full-stack AI-agency play) might hinder their chances of subsequent VC funding due to challenging scalability.

- Innovation: exploring smart glasses integration for frictionless food logging

Feedback:
• Market strategy solid (B2B2C focus), but must validate execution at scale
• Needs sharper viral growth mechanics and clear distribution roadmap","Jul 25: Team formed (Pierre – Google B2B sales, Pascal – Google product strategy). Focus: AI nutrition/chatbot app for fitness and nutrition coaching, using B2B2C partnerships with gyms/pharmacies.

Aug 4: Early traction with major players: Fitness Park (1M members, launch Sept/Oct), Groupe Mirage (26 Paris gyms acquired), Decathlon (contact with CMO, exploring freemium model). Goal: deploy in 500 Fitness Park gyms by Jan 2026, starting with 50–100 pilot gyms. Alpha app ready with nutrition tracking, macro updates, and personalized coaching; beta launch targeted for Sept. Risks flagged around dependency on external development agency (5% equity deal).

Aug 8: Pitch. Positioned as 24/7 nutritional chatbot. Market validation: 126K Twitter views, influencer support. Development challenges: GPT-4 API vs ChatGPT speed issues. B2B traction: meetings with Fitness Park, Decathlon, Newness, Basic Fit, Episode, and Alan (insurance) for wellness partnership. Launch target: mid-Sept (uncertain for pre-IC).

Aug 11: Office hours. Roadmap created for 0–3 months with sales projections. Product: base validated, but UX not yet commercial. Discussed demo dilemma (show infra vs mock-ups). Equity deal with agency considered too risky; alternatives identified (BPI grants, angels, freelancers). Target: €80–100k to fund first version without long-term equity loss.

Aug 15: Pitch. Positioned as AI nutrition companion with B2B2C via gyms/pharmacies. 4 soft partnership commitments secured. MVP due end of August, beta Sept. Feedback: strong potential but must avoid risky agency equity deal.

Aug 22: Pitch. Problem framed as global weight-loss failure rates (95%). Market: €5B nutrition apps, €15B fitness/wellness. Progress: engaged top 5 gym networks covering 40% of market, alpha version releasing end of week. Feedback: too much time on problem/solution, needs more focus on traction and distribution.

Aug 29: Pitch. Progress: 7 gym networks engaged, 2 agreed to commercialization rollout. Market approach: target 75% of French gym-goers (~€2.5–5M ARR potential). Feedback from Salomon: hot market, but crowded. Need proof of gym acquisition execution and viral loops before IC.",https://polar-scale-0bb.notion.site/FitBot-25e1466f886f80be853bc8e764b6cd42?source=copy_link,Pitch Pre-IC 08_09.pdf (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1767902400000/1FBqWkudtSe-kdGDl1HA6Q/8Rx46mTHWigoam2V5fo2GHRLwBTEaHgcRrqQbVU9_rW6kP9mGNtpehzIjDtptwQ2wTcnqos2LlvUvB4RlWApPH3ZnBg7ISUNgNXCHRbZ3JBndc9vQD0XWSZQYcuV0lhRNQbsGdG1xQr0oNJ5IZQfybCKPQb9VygRMCVJzoYjXJ8/E2AbCXM8zOGHLQIgL0IIGMvrd9TsJtVHB68v8dc9dRs),Go,,"Selection Day 30/07/2025,Selection Day 30/07/2025,Selection Day 30/07/2025,Selection Day 30/07/2025,Selection Day 30/07/2025,Pre-IC 08/09/2025,Pre-IC 08/09/2025",
