,4,5,"'- some people hardly showed up. I would be stricter with check-ins
- entire program is centered around quick scaling businesses, no deep-tech or other harder topics (which of course follow different investment the sides)
- not enough focus on unit economics and other KPI (Salomon touched on it night level) ",,4,"- Discovering other founders and their ideas
- Discovering hands-on tools
- Start-up mind set has become a builders mindset","Continue my humanoid idea, either as solo founder or marching through other sources.
Always remain open to new opportunities, too.",,maybe ,"I am grateful for Pioneers having given me a “wild card” despite not fitting totally the project profile. The program will automatically gain in maturity with future editions. Frankly, as cohort 0 this was a very nice experience. ",I feel energetic and continue my path,
,4,3,"Better takeaways and application of these takeaways from talks, speakers and masterclasses. project specific expert guidance on conforming to desired kpIs qnd progress metrics. ",,2,"a better understanding of VC requirements, the challenges in conforming businesses to VC ready investment projects. biggest teaching (not learnings) was the need to be specific about what type of project we have and seeking appropriate financing or investment.",Make Money sticking to roadmap presented at final Pitch. 1M MRR by 2027,,yes,"Clearer oversight, expectation and more investment in the selected projects with off boarding solutions and support to ensure greater over all cohort outcomes. It does not cost much to have overall greater successes in a cohort rather than only looking for the next unicorn. ",I feel energetic and continue my path,Traction / finding product-market fit
,4,5,"1.) Candidate pool
2.) Accountability for founders (no one went on the weekends, but tied to first point)
3.) Organization was good, but could be improved (expected for the first edition)",,1,"1.) Constant communication with Pioneers is key 
2.) Traction is king
3.) Distribution is key","Keep building towards traction, find out what happens with the founding team morale over the next months. Leaning towards bootstrapping, I am done with accelerators for a good time tbh.",,yes,"A more structured methodology to understand what the team progress is consistently would be greatly advantageous for everyone. Office hours and the weekly memo are a good start, take this to the next level.",I have been able to manage my energy well and it stayed stable,Building a prototype
,4,5,"More masterclasses on topics - disctibution, open SAS or company, how to sell better, and many other HOW to…
Generally I thought we will get more support on this. And educational part",,2,"To be more ambitious
Disctribution matters
Team matters more then I thought","Test few other hypotheses I had, build, sell, kill it or keep it. I give myself time up to October for 5 more ideas. ",,yes,Maybe more support on basic HOW to??? Steps.,I feel energetic and continue my path,Finding motivation to build and test every day
,3,4,"'- Less heterogeneous ambitions (US or France, Hyper scale or semi-bootstrapped, work-life balance and grind mindset
- Make VC part less dominant, more hands on workshops
- More cohesion, give Pioneers a vibe/vision so every founder is aligned and energized.",,1,"- Station F Perks
- Pitch
- Quick meetings with founders/companies","- Go to SF with my new co-founder
- Build something unreasonable",,no,"Thanks for letting me the opportunity to come into the program!
I knew most of it the people already but it was a great opportunity with great Station F perk.
It must have been hard to source profiles and congrats on that!
Can't wait to see how far you can go 💪
Let's keep in touch!",I feel energetic and continue my path,"Building a prototype,Getting the skills to iterate quickly"

Sharing some things that teams did well in challenges",,4,"Move fast
Validate early
",,,yes,"Thank you for everything, it was a very nice time :)",I feel energetic and continue my path,"Getting the skills to iterate quickly,Finding work I am very passionate about"
,4,3,"More structured time to actually build together – co-founder match or not, it would’ve helped to brainstorm and jam with others during the program.
	2.	Clearer communication on what a “Pioneers-ready” idea or team actually looks like – even if just toward the end.
	3.	More workshops or shared deep-dives. We had the right people in the room, just needed more guided collisions.",,3,"1.	Learning to “vibe code” and using the right tools.
	2.	Exposure to new tools and frameworks through osmosis (and clever people in the cohort).
	3.	Using the group as a sounding board helped me sharpen my vision and think bigger.","I’m gonna continue  to build and test ThirdPlace, a social OS that helps people form real-world connections based on shared interests and taste. I’ll be refining the prototype, validating the go-to-market, and either finding a technical co-founder or exploring creative partnerships for distribution. Pioneers gave me the momentum – I’m following it.",,maybe ,,I feel energetic and continue my path,"Building a prototype,Building a VC backable company"
,2,3,Bigger pool of candidates,,1,,Finding the right cofounder and build,,no,Get a larger pool of candidates and more local talents ,I feel energetic and continue my path,
,4,4,"First, everything I'm going to talk about is not simple to get right, just want to provide helpful feedback:

- Participants are quite varied in their backgrounds/experience on super early/early stage companies, I feel like some could be paired with more early stage veterans during the first few weeks maybe?
- There is a lot of content in the first few weeks that feels great and engaging, then a pretty hard stop in rhythm. When I came back from holidays, there was a clear rift between the few teams already formed and the rest of the batch felt aimless. Possible solutions: More handholding for matching people together, a coach that spends at least an hour a week with each group to guide them...
- More precise communication on what the team wants from each stages. Examples: 
Most of us did not really understand the point of Friday pitches, we all felt they were supposed to be there to show progress, but since we had guests almost each time, it ended up just being pitches without having time to pitch properly. 
Some projects were obviously non VC backable from scratch, I think you should be more upfront about that as well and tell people that they should switch ideas if they want to be VC backed. 

All of those points depend on the general philosophy as well, if you want a more ""sink or swim"" 2 months, most of them don't need to be addressed, it's a valid strategy to prove who has the grit to be an entrepreneur and who hasn't, but might leave introvert devs in the dirt even though they have tech skills to offer.",,4,"'- I should have started fresh (instead of keeping in mind my project or Oudavone's as is) almost back from scratch in order to benefit the most from the program
- Tech is mostly mature (or at least went back to more ""normal"" levels) and VCs might have a lesser impact than before in the space
- Importance of networking",,,maybe ,,I feel energetic and continue my path,"Finding a compatible co-founder,Traction / finding product-market fit,Building a community,Finding motivation to build and test every day"
,4,4,"I felt like I didn't get enough feedback in the Friday pitch. More hands on support from mentors to teams would be great, Not just during office hours but during the week, check in on founders and suggest changes to their approach. A bit like what founders factory promises. Especially for first time or beginner founders. 

Active follow-up from mentors after the founders submit their Monday weekly update. I got no comments or feedback about my weekly update.

The weekly themes were exciting in the beginning but when we pivoted it didn't make sense to follow the them. It felt like we were Kind of out of sync with the program",,3,"Execution and speed really matters 
Importance of clearly explaining your ideas 
Don't be shy to pivot ",Prototyping and testing distribution,,no,Thanks again for the opportunity. It was really fun and a lot of lessons learned. ,Mixed between good and bad days,"Finding work I am very passionate about,Finding a problem to work on"
,4,5,"More support to understand what is expected to fit
Specific workshops to let us grow in the right direction
Social interaction between members (daily or weekly talks)",,1,"Sometimes an agency is not so bad (when it makes money)
TRACTION TRACTION TRACTION
Getting co-founders is important, more than product ","Finish the dashboard product
