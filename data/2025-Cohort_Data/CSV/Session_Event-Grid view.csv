Exercise: The Worst Startup Idea
Goal:
 Come up with the most ridiculously bad startup idea you can think of — and pitch it like it’s the next unicorn.
How It Works
Your Mission
As a team, create and pitch the worst startup idea possible — one that is:
Incredibly niche or solves a non-problem (e.g. throw AI at everything - solution in search of a problem)
Technically or ethically flawed
Completely unscalable
Prep Time
Use this time to brainstorm and prepare a 3-4 minute pitch . Think of:
Name & tagline
Problem Slide
Solution Slide
Business Model
Target Market with Market Size
GTM Strategy / Timeline
Optional: Fundraising
Team
Pitch Time (3-4 min per group)
Each group pitches their horrible idea with full confidence — as if they truly believe in it
Voting
After all pitches, everyone votes for:
Worst Startup Idea
Most Convincing Pitch for a Bad Idea

Here is today's challenge:
:rocket: ""Build your Distribution Machine"" Challenge
 Let’s simulate your second go-to-market attempt — we want you to build a system you'd use to get your first paying users. This is a scrappy, hands-on team challenge to build and test a distribution channel in just 1.5h.
:test_tube: Step 1 – Build your Value Prop
 Pick an industry you're interested in. Build a value prop (e.g. a landing page with signup option, a newsletter, an advertisement, or a social media post). This is your smoke screen. Once you have set this up, you try to collect waitlist signups.
:magnet: Step 2 – Drive Your First Traffic
 Once your page is live, find the fastest way to market it and get your first 5+ signups. Some quick-win channels:
Product Hunt Ship, Reddit, Facebook groups, IndieHackers, in person sign ups or any other creative way
:memo: Submit by 5:45 in #submissions
Create a Google Doc with:
Project name, team members, and a 1-liner
Website link
Tool used to build the page (Webflow, Lovable, Wordpress etc.)
What channels you used to get subscribers
Number of users reached
Numbers of ""sign-ups""

A 100 EUR amazon gift card per team member will be awarded to the winning team.
Good luck to all !
@channel 

FYI:  Freelancers, early-stage solo founders, creators, indie developers, who pay for tools from their own money are NOT considered B2B customers. They are Prosumers. A B2B Customer considered for full LOI points should pay from company expenses (have cashflow) and have at least 1 Full-time employee.

Warning: :warning: We will deduct points for incomplete or poor task completions.

An LOI must have a digital or physical signature. Emails are not accepted!

a user interview should be an actual conversation with a potential user. Submission should be a recap of that conversation with key learnings!

Annoying Investor Alert - YOU ONLY HAVE UNTIL 12:10!!!
An annoying investor needs you to show up right now. The investor shows no mercy and requires you to give an update right away.
That being said. Instead of 12:20, you now only have until 12:10 to submit.
Any submissions after 12:10 are not counted and lead to disqualification.
Good luck!!

Traction Sprint Challenge (Now → Thu 1:30 PM sharp)
Hey Pioneers!
 Coming off our Customer Discovery Challenge, it’s time to turn curiosity into traction.
:dart: Your goal
B2B teams: Collect Letters of Intent (LOIs).
B2C teams: Build the largest possible community (WhatsApp, newsletter, FB Group, Telegram, IG page—your call).
 In both cases, you’re pressure-testing whether real people will commit, not just chat.
:brain: How?
Stay in your problem space (your current business idea).
Reach out relentlessly. Leverage the #ask-for-intros channel and your own networks.
Make the ask clear.
B2B: “If this solves your problem, are you willing to sign an LOI / preorder?”
B2C: “Join our community so you can ____.”
Track every touch. Airtable, sheet—whatever works, but log it.
Proof of traction (LOIs)
:email: Email confirming interest: 1 pt
:lower_left_fountain_pen: Signed LOI: 3 pts
:credit_card: Pre-order / deposit: 10 pts
Extra credit: Tough markets or especially hard-to-gather communities earn bonus points.
:page_facing_up: What to submit by Thu 1:30 PM (Google Doc)
Lead-generation methodology (bullet points)
Prospects contacted (Name / role / contact)
LOIs & community joins (type + count + total points)
Key learnings (what worked, what bombed, next moves)
Link to your live community (if B2C)
:stopwatch: Why the rush?
Conviction: Early commits validate you’re onto something.
Clarity: Not clear commitments mean pivot signals—priceless before we sink months of work. The more you learn before building the better and pivot means progress, too.
Let’s see who can turn conversations into commitments and who can otherwise pivot quickly.

Hugo: 

3 questions :
	•	“What frustrates me in the world or in society?”
	•	“What injustice or situation do I feel emotionally connected to?”
	•	“What would I fight for, even if no one else cared?”

For each participant:
	•	5 min: share their reflections, uninterrupted
	•	5 min: the two others reflect aloud:
“What did that make me feel?”
“What part resonated with me?”
“What’s the truth I heard in your story?”

Announce Groups (first group announcement - groups of 3 ideally)

afterwards: Hugo message 

Now ask yourself:
	•	What mindset do I hope I kept throughout the program?
	•	What do I want to be proud of — beyond results?
	•	What do I hope I’ve learned about myself as a founder?
	•	What do I want to remind myself about who I am today?

11:40 am (right before lunch) - Hugo
Write a letter to yourself: 
https://www.futureme.org/

What do you want to remember?
What truth do you not want to forget, no matter what happens with your startup?
What values do you want to hold on to?
Now take a step further —
What do you dream of creating?
Who do you want to serve, or fight for?
What kind of founder — and what kind of human — do you want to become?

Hello Batch – hope your week is off to a strong start.
Reminder: this week’s theme is Distribution.
AI made building easy, now the hard part is reach.
If you can’t get your product in front of the right people, it doesn’t matter how good it is.
So either:
Your product solves such a deep pain that cold outreach converts unusually well,
or
You’ll need to think way outside the box to crack your distribution.
Keep testing. Keep shipping. And remember: the best product doesn’t win, the best distribution does.",,,,,

AWS for new Founders - Announcement,7/9/2025 1:00pm,Week 5,Announce/Organisation,,,"Last-Minute Event with AWS – This Friday!
Hey @channel,
AWS offered us a slot this Friday from 3-4 pm in their AWS room (share zone).
Some of you may be building on AWS, so we’re hosting an ‘AWS session for New Founders’ - practical, not pure technical.
What to expect:
15-min business case presentation by two AWS engineers
40-min open Q&A (ask anything - tech or business!)
Based on your feedback from the Google session, this is going to be more of an interactive founder-focused discussion for both tech and business profiles

AWS for new Founders - Announcement Update (w Connor),7/9/2025 5:00pm,Week 5,Announce/Organisation,,,"Event announcement update (with Connor giving an AWS session before):

Double AWS Session This Friday :fire:
Hey @channel,
As mentioned earlier, we have an AWS session this Friday from 3–4 PM in the AWS Room (Share Zone). But since we already have our own AWS expert @Connor Blair here, we’re turning it into a double session!
Here’s the plan:
2:30–2:55 PM — AWS Perspective with Connor
We'll kick things off in the Nebuchadnezzar Room (right in front of the Pioneers space), where Connor will briefly walk you through the key AWS points and answer questions from an independent expert’s perspective.
3:00–4:00 PM — AWS Session
Then we move over to the AWS Room (Share Zone) for a short presentation and open Q&A with two AWS engineers. A great chance to ask questions - maybe even the same ones again and compare the answers from the “more biased” AWS side.
We encourage critical questions - cloud infra is often one of the backbones of your startup and AWS wants to sell to you.
TL;DR:
Friday, June 11
2:30–3:00 PM: Nebuchadnezzar Room – AWS with @Connor Blair
3:00–4:00 PM: AWS Room (Share Zone) – AWS engineer presentation + Q&A
Both events are in the calendar. Looking forward to a full-circle session from both an independent expert and AWS itself!

Announcing Weekly Theme: Pivoting,7/14/2025 11:00am,Week 6,Announce/Organisation,,,"Hey @channel,
This Week’s Theme is: Pivoting
Either your idea got validated, meaning real people were willing to try or even pay for it, or… it didn’t.
If you got traction:
Double down. Take your learnings and optimize your positioning:
Sharpen who your ideal customer is
Refine your messaging and value proposition
Improve onboarding or UX for better conversion
Push toward more proof (repeat usage, new users, or actual payments)
If you didn’t get traction:
That’s totally fine, most don’t. You now need to pivot, and the faster, the better.
Your options:
Hard Pivot (changing the core of the business):
New customer segment
New core problem
New solution or product
Entirely new market
Soft Pivot (same direction, but refined):
Reframing the value prop, narrowing or expanding the user persona
Reworking the channel or go-to-market
Changing the feature focus
Whatever path you’re on, this week is about building clarity and making bold, informed moves.
You’re expected NOT to get things right. You are expected to learn fast and act.",,,,,

First off, thank you for your commitment and effort over the past six weeks. You all deserve a lot of credit. Evaluating your progress wasn’t easy. We faced several edge cases, and early-stage investing is, by definition, shaped by subjective judgment.
A note to those not selected:
Don’t let this stop you, keep building. We’re fully aware that we can make mistakes. Also, some of the best founders I backed at Hook had pitched to us multiple times before getting an investment. You remain part of the Pioneers community and and we’ll be keeping an eye on your progress.
To the selected teams:
This is far from a win. You’ve cleared a checkpoint but there’s still a long way to go to be investment-ready for the IC. There were no clear yes and you’ll all need to seriously accelerate execution and focus on validating core assumptions.
Next steps:

Pre-IC Decision Announcement,9/9/2025 11:00am,Week 14 - Sprint Channel,Announce/Organisation,,,"Hey Everyone @channel,
It’s Decision Time!!!
This was very hard decision to make as we’ve been working alongside you for a long time and have developed affinities with each team. Also, we can make mistakes – companies we’ve rejected in the past have gone to be great companies!
So….. After careful evaluation and deliberations with Hugo and the Pioneers team, the following startups have been selected for the Investment Committee:
Umamy
Mirmi
JooobAI
AvaHome
FitBot
GovIntel
A reminder of the Selection criteria (in order of importance):
Execution – GTM traction and product progress
Team – background, cohesion, and founder-product fit
Market – size and potential
 What’s next:
Office Hours: For the teams not moving forward, we’re hosting a feedback session starting at 3pm at the Hogwarts Room next to our space. Please text @Niklas - Pioneers Team  to book your slot.
We do realise that some teams are too early in their adventure and need a bit more time (August timing wasn’t great): we are forecasting to host one more IC in about a month – if you show traction, reach out to us. Any team in the sprint phase is eligible.
Post-IC For those not advancing: you may stay at Station F until the end of November, but since you’re not officially in the program anymore, you would need to cover the cost your seat (€259 + VAT/month/per seat). You all may stay at the Pioneers space until Monday without additional cost.
And ofcourse: you are now part of the Pioneers alumni community meaning you will be invited to our events, workshops and will be fasttracked for consideration for future cohorts :muscle:
Now it’s time for the remaining teams to rock it during the IC this Friday, let’s go!!!!


Hugo's follow-on message: 

Hey Everyone,
I just want to take a moment to say how proud you can be of what you’ve accomplished so far. Whether you’re moving forward to the IC or not, this is just one step in a much longer journey.
As far as I know, building a company is a marathon with many ups and downs; today’s decision doesn’t define your future. What matters is the grit, creativity, and persistence you bring to the adventure. Keep pushing, keep learning, and remember that every milestone (even the tough ones) is part of building something truly meaningful.
We’re rooting for all of you!

Hi @channel,
This Friday we’re getting together for a group lunch at La Felicità at 12:00 PM. I just added the event to the calendar.
It’s completely optional of course, especially if you’re focused on IC prep. But in case you come, it is a good way to get a last motivational push from the Pioneers crowd :blush:
We’ll also be handing back the letters you wrote to yourselves during Hugo’s Base Camp Session on Day 2.
If you can’t make it, you can always drop by next week or the week after to get your letter (a good excuse to say hi to Maxime and Aïda).
Friday will also be my last day at Pioneers. Not a goodbye though, I’ll still be in Paris most of the time and stay connected to the ecosystem.

@channel
:clap: Well done everyone – today’s Pre-IC was a big milestone. You’ve all put in 3 months of intense work, and it showed. I saw some big leaps of improvement in your pitches (but there’s still some work to do though :slightly_smiling_face: ).
We’ll be sharing the result tomorrow morning to make sure we take the best decision on a clear head after a long day.
Next stop: La Felicita for drinks in 10 minutes to celebrate this milestone. See you there! :fire:",,,,,
