Tripled lead generation in 6 months through fractional C-level roles, driving GTM execution and cross-border expansion in Europe.
Led strategic partnerships and commercial growth, managing 30+ sponsors and 100+ speakers at a tech summit.","What I am interested in working on:":"Problem I'm currently working on solving: Young borrowers under 30 face systematic barriers within European credit scoring systems that stem from the fundamental design of traditional risk assessment methodologies. The emphasis on historical credit performance and established financial relationships inherently disadvantages individuals who have had limited time to develop comprehensive credit histories or accumulate substantial assets that serve as collateral or demonstrate financial stability.

With major players such as Schufa Holding AG, Experian, and other commercial listed companies controlling significant portions of European credit information systems, young borrowers who have primarily engaged with alternative financial services or maintained minimal traditional banking relationships may find their creditworthiness inadequately represented in standard assessment processes.

Solution: Behavioral credit scoring represents a paradigm shift in financial risk assessment, leveraging non-traditional data sources to evaluate creditworthiness. This approach analyzes patterns in digital transactions, social media interactions, mobile usage, and other behavioral indicators to complement or replace traditional metrics like payment history and debt-to-income ratios. In Europe, where 22% of adults lack access to traditional credit products, behavioral scoring offers potential solutions for financial inclusion while introducing complex regulatory considerations under evolving EU frameworks.","Introduction:":"Hi, I'm Tea.

Open to working with almost any industry, but the more specific the product, the better. ","Introduction:":"I have a technical background from my studies in Computer Engineering in Brazil and in the French engineering school CentraleSupélec. 
After my studies I worked as a Product Manager at ForePaaS, a startup in the cloud/data/ML space. There, I led the development of multiple products and I shaped our product management division ultimately contributing to the startup’s acquisition by the OVHcloud. 
At OVH, I led a few AI product efforts, however, corporate work felt like wasting my life, so I quit to start my own startup. 
Last year, I co-founded BrodAI, an AI agent company to automate SEO marketing for e-commerce SMBs. I was CTO and I coded the entire stack: the AI agent, the backend, the frontend and the associated infrastructure. 
In just a couple of months, we had a functional SEO AI agent, our first paying e‑commerce customers and a pre‑seed term sheet from a venture capital fund. 
Before we signed it however, my co‑founder decided to step back for personal reasons.
Right now I am looking to find the right co-founder to go all-in on a startup idea. I have a few ideas of my own but I am willing to explore others as well.","Nationality":["Brazil"],"Companies Worked":["OVHCloud","ForePaas"],"Education":["CentraleSupélec"],"Gender":"Male","Years of XP":"4","Degree":["masters"],"Academic Field":["engineering","computer science"],"Founder":"Artur Vianna","left program":"left after Selection Day","Batch":"S25"}},{"id":"recWl5MrCpttzr74h","createdTime":"2025-06-02T19:07:48.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Anthony Haddad","Status":"Yes, I am available full time.","Whatsapp":"+33760506295","Email":"haddad.anthony26@gmail.com","Your photo":[{"id":"attMf6tncKBrzjpku","width":5184,"height":3456,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/RaUf6wQIaf4L0mE9KJc-wA/McOr1DMO2s-kG7xNHM2snH6pSYRJaJt19Wvlh9W5SrTYZ96cdlkfQLxcZKEqeQuYFpPr7F3L8c8e2hTcHFyxRNYMTxlshFA38_SKwC3li1qQvlGYtRhyznS4n2P4ixe-9-5-oMPiAlbSonzqRdOeYoj1T8kltYnQr53K1E-OkPo5Ms3zdB_sV1DxsApaY906/URZdE0VmIoEC2Wm1xJ7G_DHZYCINu_n_6OrGlV02axY","filename":"Anthony HADDAD - Profile Picture.jpg","size":5057874,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/8T0ORzedmFms_U8m6EFaMQ/RFE-NWLsCSx4ka5cUeppRG51LSyvXOPjwUpicOOyCnbzmGuQ8N-1i0R7FTTpZmNG143SauR_j2muO7AqfGjyGtrj7_lslhOBB2XMPGCbljYwKFte6K8bMi7MRwbQGPkZJw2-iTAgLSD8AW0aQ5SAEw/QJlGaXKEpEaO51_PtKOq5KJcCpPGjC48kGFjxRgxESQ","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/r8fHIzhdTCNMNp7-DoupVw/kG96eACd4Sh-57Dz056ii2bNN0cJj9eEmrxbV3tkc0JwbkhVJvktoVRyaJ_rXF6GUGc_wc_qBlobvZxTJ5Jz8ygqdObAMcRrj-OcYU4R6EjmoSDlnf034ry1V73X0jgXml7XWZNZWeeF_aHw_ESCqQ/qJP32GI8Xc9kf44QpoCE_T3XMfbNfUgdID-kJu_Hzmw","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/ZikLN3_syuxKt3kz8YMrqw/ZGkQuCSdo-5-nYax474LAL1DUUGiPG5JtqErYihDlayjgty4m7HiSWQCZtTAnXycnuXi2RYkwsnIUeJ7LuidxPPkmH85-a2hpeL4H2WylGSKWpxkynq5OJOeKr9wfjq2IzGtvkym4T1-TIdALdhsMg/gwwn_fyBReJIzLDO1zWkY7BO3YNTscFvet-WhNVN6Aw","width":3000,"height":2000}}}],"Do you have an existing project/idea ?":"Yes","Are you open to join another project during the program?

I believe strongly in the “brownfield” concept—where human-form robots, powered by advanced AI, can integrate into existing environments and have a transformative impact. As a platform technology, humanoid robotics presents vast entrepreneurial potential. It can play a critical role in re-industrializing Europe and addressing structural challenges such as labor shortages in aging societies, as well as strengthening defense and technological sovereignty.

The timing is right for a generational opportunity: to build foundational infrastructure for the future—rooted in Europe, serving the world.","Introduction:":"I am an experienced startup builder and operator with a successful exit (in 2005) and over 20 years navigating the French and German tech and e-commerce landscapes.

More importantly, it exposed me to the deep operational problems that logistics teams face daily, and that hands-on experience is what continues to shape how I think about solving problems today.","What I am interested in working on:":"I am interested in building a product that helps logistics operators turn fragmented data into real-time operational insights and automates their workflows.

After experiencing firsthand the chaos of fragmented tools and constant crisis management, I decided to build the solution I wished we’d had: real-time clarity for operators. I bring deep operational insight, strong founder grit, and a bias for action.

Born in India, now based in Paris (my 5th country after stints in Singapore, Dubai, and briefly the US). My journey started early: I wrote my first lines of C++ at 8, and by 11, I was interning at my first startup — debugging, shipping, and falling in love with building. That love never left.

Over the years, I’ve built and scaled products and tech teams from scratch, wearing every startup hat — from writing backend code to pitching investors. I’m a technical founder at heart, with deep expertise in distributed systems and high-throughput platforms. I can code 0 to 1, and scale processes and teams from 1 to 100.

I have a hustler–builder bias. While I’ve done pre-sales, led teams, shipped code, hired and fired, and handled operations, tech, and business strategy - I am at my best building products. I believe in fast iterations, staying uncomfortable, and surrounding myself with people who raise the bar.

PS:
While I have led and can do web app development, understand and build mobile apps - my current strengths are in building data platforms, web services (backend), infra setup and automation, designing scalable architectures and multiple clouds. 

I am very impact driven. I plan to aim high, build something of value for others while generating value for myself. I have had the most joy when others tell me they love what I have built and this motivates me.","Nationality":["India"],"Companies Worked":["Shift Technology","Repeat Founder"],"Education":[" Vellore Institute of Technology"],"Gender":"Male","Years of XP":"14","Degree":["bachelor"],"Academic Field":["computer science"],"Founder":"Adhityan KV","Batch":"S25"}},{"id":"recmyt0P2EoaePVny","createdTime":"2025-06-01T08:33:32.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Thamanna Razak","Status":"Yes, I am available full time.","Whatsapp":"+33758580593","Email":"thamanna.razak@gmail.com","Your photo":[{"id":"attQ1ayOWRUsbOdxZ","width":3024,"height":2746,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/O4KCAYMLB82f8Iu9Ye1aTw/iKwqkEgf1l1nOvE1dW_h8jWlKVGWdz4TIC4hO8yyZZs-3WrtCpjNY6TdXgC3nW7ieHgZxhIqFnP37kqDI2enjmKRS0RITh0a1yfk9-sB0jmyoVSgPTENLcv5W4d7ivhas_MxuA4bqV4hEFY0EOOv6IAIl3f9RPFtzH1Is9G4ztM/PLuCtr3pTo5XmrCeJmIGwUYyvJ-8WzeUXHam5FbGn-I","filename":"IMG_1015.jpg","size":982133,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/iNPEsfPIujjxxqjUHhnWmA/QJcmRSBb7lQXE3580LtoDSwZvRRW_VByt3P6jRskumhvms6gWvi4oA_f2Z-Myuz7PnmdIEc3lCyc6-yQ2H2bqAu57AVy-bf6oXnADID9j7h6hcquvhj6FbVzT6_1wgT9TDDZQPCD1YDonClVx95Iwg/-uR6B_zz0mX10bfolcTVs5wbqdnUZ7zvhE2LKJ0EgTI","width":40,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/VbxnxKt91tRPHJV_svUzcQ/tMo8FLnnIzwrA1gAyyCGyatVD04izFFsAlsKUqfkAqf-BakM1Mg1ygn6JenopfK69R-JbtK2qR32lWvLfui0GyeFzKPawxTDgPXju3nPbuqyKWYhBiJHIcjijOHJCOgON0APvh-ryH1Cz9KtfvG5oA/KG9AnzKEVxCzxV2beCtio_1_MEtRulabn5eCcTViDLg","width":564,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/JxsSOR0_CByky4BGa9McAg/rT85gThKCmNeg7Isr6qup_P-oB7y_Nrnzr2A0wkY3c4naYnnTIJ9j6B3HEzkplRlN8Zvg-qgTdfnmnuqCJLWfpD5o5vpZca67eo_gO3hjHLD_Nc2cjvLR64DYCwHIhAdE7GrsnwYvQwji0f_JH8nvA/EtJzcoA4RU-UQzYA65VIGOHKeKzHCYCQmwrqt1mGVT4","width":3000,"height":2724}}}],"Do you have an existing project/idea ?":"Yes","If yes, explain it in a few words":"I am available in person for almost all of the three months but have a pre planned trip for two weeks in August.

Worked at the most important energy company of the country. Horrible experience, but learned quite a bit. 

Then joined Sparkmate, a start-up studio that aims to ship company in 5 weeks, whatever the subject. Worked on an AI-powered ERP for top insurance company, a children story telling box powered by AI (start-up raised > 10M), a bus that recharges while moving, fencing shoes.

I spent my last 3 years on developping an innovative solution for information extraction from news texts.

One of my key achievements was developing an ML model that matches the quality of existing solutions while being 500 times smaller and 20 times faster. 

I'm excited about the potential for ML and AI to transform the entire industries. I believe my combination of technical expertise and entrepreneurial mindset will help me to build something valuable and scalable. However, I recognize that to truly make a meaningful impact, then I need a co-founder with strong business acumen.","Nationality":["Russia"],"Companies Worked":["INRAE"],"Education":["Université Paris Saclay"],"Gender":"Female","Years of XP":"3","Degree":["PhD"],"Academic Field":["computer science","NLP"],"Founder":"Mariya Borovikova","Batch":"S25"}},{"id":"recxMLPCJm14cH7GN","createdTime":"2025-06-24T17:02:36.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Zaccarie Morel","Status":"Yes, I am available full time.","Whatsapp":"+33660117897","Email":"zaccarie.morel@gmail.com","Your photo":[{"id":"att0ZNv7emPoWTrfk","width":391,"height":391,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/zFGQXvxK8Qh2v938E_Gp_g/YKzKrcg59334grdjhpMjIVTwASqUlweBPQB9HKizoTeRQKcnXfDn2C6IFcnBwgopYFlP7FCrgkLslvITQcczwTsaJdyWNOlnSFFp0iifiQXpZbfdTBX_w7nGrtCHrzVgm1CP9ctSK7vk29QSOQKrzz0Km9j_Io8AaTmphFgoUA4/AOj_EoB8qwURceEuSY0iMYaH2xHHLRqBkIGZ9tQ4Iro","filename":"1735921567905 (3).jpeg","size":24667,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/iZXF61xJkv2KxbwAVutagg/77lfyd-R3MbjNeqsuzQcUkBO5HbVup4wAY3zMScEi0GFdxg69y543FAn1EdoVfjf2X1ljIBB65DSeBt88F42PM0W1odohbNYACER3paOa-5CeZ4AQNPmnzEBEoVdijXlhbGOpRUxQMTgTYCumVaErA/bBJqBl9XimMwq-HFUgTULmLX8goNVGsy5hrQNqTHauo","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/m0fKYCI2bzmjQ8PFhN9A8g/r4HDwUpB06ADDAeZ9SuEtEngPLj7A9VuP1IZcvbJ59AlCdCNrAOBE-xr6GPGUdNXPKJDoJe9jXsXfuRxWiFi1CThISDcPwKA3fkVnHs3AHXgM_TH3PBU4qkPD5rOXAemONmuJRgws_QVGlfibHx_Ug/MtvoF5T2E5A5efZdJkMqV6xk5gdWdSeEMP7VUI1yFFM","width":391,"height":391},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768413600000/KTXQV4MQPY4Jul4KVL9CNA/rayNIRcAseulgdK1vWa9DyPfwXu3f0ElBg-ciyTa5YcWSrLHBuQFu47ePIFN57erhQ7mFjfDgMaOdGSpIZ68-RxRvrG6GYmP0-2fcH9F_xTbDWAVRXGH8RccOYKKiPxWeHaaViu5sTLODHzfX8DatA/B4cgMgTDkEfqPNELeYBXpjbXdS8ownlOx-X5Nk1JlZY","width":391,"height":391}}}],"Do you have an existing project/idea ?":"Yes","Are you open to join another project during the program?
