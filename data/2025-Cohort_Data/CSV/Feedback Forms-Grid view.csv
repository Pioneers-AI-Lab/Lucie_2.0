Thanks for filling out the form!,8,"turned out to be very difficult, because every idea has something good in it",8,"very good to get started with at the very beginning of the program, very well moderated by Hugo",5,too much theory and checklists,9,showed me that everything can be done if you you just go for it,,,7,"real startup life lesson, very informative and engaging for me",9,"created team spirit, showed me how to move fast and achieve results quickly",8,"liked the gamification part , created competition, did not like the change, had a feeling that I did not contribute much on both teams",,did not participate,"overall the program helped to get to know most of the participants better, the 3min personal pitch is a key element for this, maybe to extend it to 5min and do it at the very beginning",,
Thanks for filling out the form!,10,,10,,10,,10,,,,9,"During the presentation, people ask questions, a few a ok, but sometimes there can be many. which interrupts the flow. And didn't leave us much time to see all the slides.",10,,10,,9,Would love to learn more about non tech / productivity tools from google,"Loving it so far, super engaging workshops and challenges.

I have been paired with same team members quite a few times, i would have loved to be paired with new people. These exercises are great to see how people work.

Thank you team!",,
Thanks for filling out the form!,10,,9,,10,,10,,,,9,,10,,10,More points on B2B projects as it is harder to get an LOI that find a potential customer for B2C.,8,,,,
Thanks for filling out the form!,,,10,I really appreciated taking the time to connect and discover other founders’ profiles. I felt a strong sense of belonging to a powerful and supportive community.,,,,,,,10,A great introduction to a very useful toolbox. I came away with practical strategies and ideas I can already apply to my own project.,10,"An incredibly exciting exercise. It gave me the opportunity to collaborate with two amazing personalities and observe how highly competent people work. I learned a lot, both personally and professionally.",10,"Definitely the highlight of the week! A high-energy challenge that pushed us to be creative, fast, and aligned as a team.",,,"A very positive first week. I’m still juggling between Pioneers and my main project, but this second week should allow me to dive deeper and explore potential matches more thoroughly.",,
Thanks for filling out the form!,10,"Very funny, need solution for repeated ChatGPT ideas",10,,3,"Slides in French and little of the information was applicable to our particular Context at Pioneers.
For me personally, there was little, if anything new.",7,,,,9,Unfortunate that we could not finish,7,Unclear if it was only inboud at the beginning,8,"Good and fun.
Just ban Station F ideas next time.
Also, could be good to ask for people to try to organize into teams themselves and propose that they think about real ideas for this a day or two before the program.",7,"First part very good, the Google Cloud workshop felt more like an advertisement for GCP and could have been a YT video.",,,
,6,,10,"Awesome timing, great content",7,"Presentation in French (I'm not a speaker), limited value",6,"For all the challenges:

1. The random pairing removed the benefit of getting to know with whom I work efficiently from my shortlist. Most of the time, I was paired with people I knew I don't click with.
2. The limited time frame (2h) meant we could spend max 20-30 min on ideation. This meant all the ideas were shallow and more for the sake of the challenge. If there was more time, 3-4h, that would give time to develop an idea that we would be enthusiastic about.",,,10,"This was great level of detail, and I wish it was longer",7,,8,,4,"For technical people, it was very shallow, for non-technical, it was too deep. I believe it would be more useful to focus on principles, e.g. advantages of serverless, than specific products","The personal pitches on Monday came too late, it was at the moment when I already talked to most of people. If personal pitches would happen Friday morning / Thursday afternoon, they would be much more useful, to quickly understand the background and projects people want to work on.",,
Thanks for filling out the form!,10,"Good icebreaker, keep it",7,"It was good, not my fav but excellent to start to know ppl",2,Terrible french accent,6,Good challenge but raise the stakes,,,3,Not engaging,6,"I liked it, my team was not that involved",10,Best thing to have done,10,Excellent understanding,"Good, thnx for the beers on thurs

-G",10,"Amazing, outstanding"
,8,"Didn't like the matched group.
Pitching for bad idea reduce the stress, was my first time pitching so was nice.",8,"Was a bit far.
Great intervenant, loved the reflection on ourselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Station F is an amazing asset and a real game changer.
The cohort is incredibly diverse in profiles, ambitions, backgrounds, and ages.
Only a few are truly focused on the U.S. market and ready to invest the time it takes, given personal constraints like family or finances.
Loving the program so far. Thanks for setting it up!",10,"Great guy, good insights, love the no BS format.
Maybe we should limit to 1 question per people so that would ease the Q&A."
Thanks for filling out the form!,9,,7,An off-site event is great. I would like more action-based events rather than questions/answers. But I am an action guy so to be taken with a pinch of salt.,7,I think I would have liked more numbers: statistics on how teams fared depending on their starting composition,10,"Super-cool, very nice to be hands-on.",,,10,Super-clear.,10,"Super-cool, learnt a lot of stuff from other teammates.",10,Great,7,"Slightly too technical for me, maybe separate sessions for tech guys and less tech guys.","Above expectations, I got to learn a lot of stuff and meet extremely smart individuals!",10,Great insights and very accessible
Thanks for filling out the form!,8,Great to start learning with the cohort,10,"Great exercices, I plan to reuse it w/ my cofounders",7,Maybe a bit more good sense reflexions,8,"Great challenge with Jules we did a network storm for each other, we got great results! We should do it with every Pioneers team to get every one into many demos ",,,,could not attend,,could not attend,8,Great to scan every one's way of working. I like the fact that I worked with Connor with who i team up,3,Less ez to understand ,"Great tools to get to know each others, now i believe it is time to focus on execution :) ",8,Great talk and Q&A 
Thanks for filling out the form!,9,,10,"Very deep, and fun exercise to get to know everyone",10,,10,,,,10,,10,,10,"Not only directed at this challenge but I would have liked a quick session afterwards from you guys. 

Something along the lines: we saw the following that went well and also give some sort of direction what could have be done better. 

Highlighting and sharing some things that you liked from what you saw. (Just a quick 15 min session)",10,,Overall very happy with the program so far!,10,Super cool session
Thanks for filling out the form!,9,Nice game as ice breaker,9,"Missed the first part in the morning, yet the afternoon session was very good. We could have shortened the lunch break.",5,Having some difficulty to remember the session. From what I recall it was okay-ish. ,8,Fun session and useful exercise. Should have read the mum test prior to it. ,,,8,,10,(missed the session because of external meeting),7,"Great idea, though I guess the gamification provoked a team-strategy that did not allow for the highest quality, but rather the highest quantity",7,did not feel it was so relevant ... right now.,"Good cohort, great vides, and positive spirit. As the scheduled sessions decrease, we'll see how it continues. Would be nice to be able to dial in via Google Meet for weekly checkins for those not able to attend in person.
",9,Liked it !
