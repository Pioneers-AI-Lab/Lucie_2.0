      {
        "question": "How does team formation work in the Pioneers program?",
        "answer": "Team formation typically happens in the first few weeks of the program. Teams are formed based on complementary skills, shared interests in problem spaces, and alignment on vision. Most teams consist of 2-3 co-founders with technical, business, and domain expertise. The program facilitates connections between solo founders and helps teams find the right co-founder fit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change teams or pivot during the program?",
        "answer": "Yes, team changes and pivots are possible during the program. Some teams experience co-founder departures or additions as they validate their ideas and find the right fit. The Pioneers team provides support during these transitions. Breakups aren't taboo - the program prioritizes finding the right team composition over maintaining original arrangements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if there's a co-founder conflict?",
        "answer": "Co-founder conflicts do arise and the Pioneers team provides support to address them. Common issues include communication breakdowns, unclear role divisions, and misalignment on vision. The team offers mediation, frameworks for resolving conflicts, and guidance on when to make difficult decisions. Addressing conflicts early is crucial, especially before major milestones like the Investment Committee."

    "progress_tracking": [
      {
        "question": "How is startup progress tracked during the program?",
        "answer": "Startup progress is tracked through multiple channels: weekly updates submitted via Airtable form, Friday pitches where teams present to the cohort, office hours with the Pioneers team for detailed feedback, and milestone presentations at Selection Day and Investment Committee. Teams maintain detailed progress timelines documenting customer conversations, product development, traction metrics, and key learnings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should be included in weekly updates?",
        "answer": "Weekly updates should include: key metrics (customer conversations, LOIs signed, revenue), product development milestones, traction summary (paying customers, design partners, pipeline), challenges and blockers you're facing, plans for the upcoming week, and specific areas where you need support. Updates inform the investment committee about your trajectory."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do teams pitch during the program?",
        "answer": "Teams pitch regularly throughout the program. Friday pitches happen weekly at 3-5 PM where teams in the sprint phase present their progress to the cohort and Pioneers team. Major milestone pitches include Selection Day (for advancing to sprint phase) and Pre-IC/Investment Committee presentations. Teams receive feedback after each pitch to refine their story and strategy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the typical startup journey during the accelerator?",
        "answer": "The typical journey: Week 1-4: Team formation, customer discovery (50-100 interviews), problem validation. Week 4-8: MVP development, design partners, early traction (LOIs, pilots). Week 8+: Sprint phase with paying customers, refining product-market fit, scaling customer acquisition. Milestones include Selection Day (Week 8) and Investment Committee (Week 13-14) for selected teams."
      }
    ],
    "traction_and_validation": [
      {
        "question": "What counts as meaningful traction?",
        "answer": "Meaningful traction includes: paying customers or paid pilots (even small amounts like €250-500/month show commitment), signed LOIs (Letters of Intent) with clear next steps, design partners actively using your product, concrete revenue pipeline with validated pricing, and measurable user engagement metrics. The key is demonstrating real customer willingness to pay, not just interest."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many customer conversations should I have?",
        "answer": "Successful teams typically conduct 50-100+ customer conversations during the program. Early stage (Weeks 1-4): 50-100 interviews for problem validation. Growth stage (Weeks 4-8): 20-50 conversations with qualified prospects. Examples: Teams reaching IC often have 100+ outreach attempts, 15-25 engaged prospects, and 4-7 serious leads or design partners."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's an LOI and why is it important?",
        "answer": "An LOI (Letter of Intent) is a signed document indicating a prospect's serious interest in becoming a paying customer. It demonstrates validation beyond verbal interest. Strong LOIs include: digital or physical signature (emails don't count), specific pricing or pilot terms, clear timeline for conversion, and commitment from decision-makers. Converting LOIs to paid pilots/customers is the key milestone."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a design partner?",
        "answer": "A design partner is an early customer who works closely with you to shape the product in exchange for discounted or free access. They provide detailed feedback, test iterations, and validate product-market fit. Design partners should be highly engaged, representative of your target market, and willing to become paying customers once the product matures. Aim for 2-5 design partners before scaling."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I validate my market opportunity?",
        "answer": "Market validation involves: conducting customer interviews with target users, identifying clear pain points they're willing to pay to solve, getting LOIs or paid pilots to prove willingness to pay, sizing your addressable market (realistic TAM/SAM/SOM), identifying 3-5 competitors and your differentiation, and demonstrating early traction with target customers. The best validation is customers paying for your solution."
      }
    ],
    "product_development": [
      {
        "question": "When should I start building my product?",
        "answer": "Start building after validating the problem through customer interviews (typically 30-50 conversations). Many teams begin with a demo or MVP in Weeks 2-4 to test with prospects. The key is not to build in isolation - show prototypes early, gather feedback continuously, and iterate quickly. Some teams launch alpha/beta versions within 4-6 weeks of starting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between alpha, beta, and MVP?",
        "answer": "Alpha is an early internal version for initial testing and feedback, often with core features incomplete. Beta is a more polished version released to design partners and early users for real-world testing. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the simplest version that delivers core value and can be sold to customers. Most teams launch beta versions within 6-8 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use external developers or build in-house?",
        "answer": "This depends on your team's technical capabilities and the product complexity. Having a technical co-founder is strongly preferred as it enables fast iteration and reduces costs. If using external developers: negotiate carefully on equity (5%+ deals can be risky), consider alternatives like BPI grants or angel funding, ensure you maintain IP control, and plan to bring development in-house eventually."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if my product is ready to launch?",
        "answer": "Your product is ready when: it solves the core problem identified in customer interviews, 2-3 design partners can use it successfully and provide feedback, it delivers clear value that customers will pay for, and you can demonstrate it in pitches and demos. Don't wait for perfection - launch early, gather feedback, and iterate. Many successful teams launch alpha versions within 4-6 weeks."
      }
    ],
    "pitching_and_feedback": [
      {
        "question": "How should I structure my pitch?",
        "answer": "Effective pitch structure: Problem (1-2 slides, focus on pain point not just market stats), Solution (1-2 slides, show product clearly), Traction (2-3 slides with metrics: customers, revenue, pipeline), Market (1 slide with realistic sizing), Business Model (1 slide with unit economics), Team (1 slide with relevant background), and Ask (funding amount and use of funds). Spend 50%+ time on traction and differentiation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common pitch mistakes to avoid?",
        "answer": "Common mistakes: spending too much time on problem/market (more than 30-40% of slides), not showing clear traction metrics, unclear differentiation from competitors, vague or unrealistic market sizing, weak team credentials presentation, missing 'ask' slide (funding amount and use), poor demo or no product shown, and talking about features instead of customer value and outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I respond to feedback during pitches?",
        "answer": "Listen actively and take notes during feedback sessions. Don't be defensive - investors and mentors are helping you see blind spots. Ask clarifying questions to understand the concern. Implement feedback before the next pitch if it's valid. Track which feedback themes repeat across multiple people. Focus on feedback about traction, differentiation, and market sizing as these are most critical for investment decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do investors look for in pitches?",
        "answer": "Investors prioritize: (1) Execution - real traction with paying customers or strong pipeline, (2) Team - relevant background, cohesion, and founder-product fit, (3) Market - large addressable market with clear growth potential, (4) Differentiation - what you do better than competitors, (5) Business model - path to profitability with strong unit economics, and (6) Vision - ambitious but achievable roadmap."

    ],
    "market_and_industry": [
      {
        "question": "What industries do Pioneers startups typically focus on?",
        "answer": "Pioneers startups span diverse industries including FinTech (credit scoring, payments), HR Tech (staffing, recruitment), GovTech (procurement intelligence), Health/Fitness (nutrition, wellness), LegalTech (legal automation), PropTech (real estate technology), DevTools (developer infrastructure), Logistics (supply chain), and Social Tech (AI companions). The program is industry-agnostic but focuses on scalable tech solutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I size my market correctly?",
        "answer": "Use the TAM-SAM-SOM framework: TAM (Total Addressable Market) is the total market revenue if you had 100% market share. SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) is the portion you can realistically reach with your product. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) is what you can capture in 3-5 years. Be realistic and bottom-up: count actual customers you can reach, not just top-down industry statistics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle a crowded market?",
        "answer": "In crowded markets: focus on a specific niche or sub-segment where you can dominate, demonstrate clear differentiation (10x better, not 10% better), show strong early traction that proves your approach works, build unique distribution channels or partnerships that competitors can't easily replicate, and emphasize your team's unique insights or expertise. Investors want to see why you'll win despite competition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I focus on B2B or B2C?",
        "answer": "B2B is generally easier to validate and scale in an accelerator timeframe as you can reach paying customers faster, have shorter sales cycles with SMBs, charge more per customer (higher ACV), and demonstrate clear ROI. B2C can work but requires strong distribution (partnerships with gyms, platforms, etc.) or viral growth mechanics. Many successful teams use B2B2C models to leverage existing customer bases."
      }
    ],
    "investment_readiness": [
      {
        "question": "What's the Investment Committee (IC) and how does it work?",
        "answer": "The Investment Committee is the final milestone where selected teams pitch for potential investment from Pioneers. Teams typically present a 5-minute pitch followed by 7 minutes of Q&A. The IC evaluates based on execution (traction and product progress), team quality (background, cohesion, founder-product fit), and market potential. Teams selected at Pre-IC (Week 13-14) advance to the IC."
      },
      {
        "question": "What traction do I need to be investment-ready?",
        "answer": "Investment-ready traction typically includes: 1-3 paying customers or paid pilots (even small amounts show validation), €20-50K ARR or strong revenue pipeline, 3-5 design partners actively using the product, clear unit economics and path to profitability, proven customer acquisition channel, and measurable growth trajectory. The exact metrics vary by industry and business model."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prepare for the Investment Committee?",
        "answer": "IC preparation includes: refining your pitch deck with emphasis on traction (spend 50%+ time on this), practicing your pitch multiple times, preparing for tough questions on differentiation and market sizing, having a clear 'ask' slide (funding amount and use of funds), attending Pre-IC for feedback, demonstrating your product with a strong demo, addressing previous feedback from pitches, and showing momentum and growth trajectory."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I'm not selected for the IC?",
        "answer": "If not selected at Selection Day: you receive 1-on-1 feedback from the Pioneers team explaining the decision and providing guidance, you can stay at Station F until November (at your own cost: €259 + VAT/month/seat), you join the Pioneers alumni community with access to events and workshops, and you're fast-tracked for consideration in future cohorts if you show progress. The team may schedule a follow-up IC if you demonstrate strong traction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the selection criteria for advancing in the program?",
        "answer": "Selection criteria in order of importance: (1) Execution - GTM traction (paying customers, LOIs, pipeline) and product progress (working MVP, design partners), (2) Team - relevant background, cohesion, and strong founder-product fit, (3) Market - large addressable market with realistic sizing and clear growth potential. Teams are evaluated at Selection Day (Week 8) and Pre-IC (Week 13-14)."

    ],
    "go_to_market_strategy": [
      {
        "question": "How do I find my first customers?",
        "answer": "Effective customer acquisition strategies: cold outreach (emails, LinkedIn) to 100+ prospects - expect 10-20% response rate, warm introductions through advisors, program mentors, or the Pioneers network, attending industry events and conferences, partnerships with companies that have your target customers (B2B2C model), and content marketing or social proof (Twitter validation, influencer support). The key is high-volume outreach with personalized messaging."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a realistic customer acquisition timeline?",
        "answer": "Typical timelines: First conversations (Week 1-2): 50-100 cold calls/emails → 10-20 responses. Design partners (Week 4-6): 15-25 engaged prospects → 2-5 design partners. Paid pilots (Week 6-10): Clear value demonstration → 1-3 paid pilots at €250-500/month. First full customers (Week 10-14): Proven ROI → 1-5 paying customers at target pricing. B2B cycles are faster (4-12 weeks) than enterprise sales (3-6 months)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I focus on product or sales first?",
        "answer": "Balance both simultaneously: Do customer discovery and sales outreach from Day 1 - don't wait for a perfect product. Build an MVP or demo within 2-4 weeks to show prospects. Continue sales conversations while iterating on product based on feedback. The best products emerge from tight customer feedback loops. Teams that focus only on building often miss market needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I price my product?",
        "answer": "Pricing strategies: Start with customer interviews to understand willingness to pay and budget ranges. For design partners, charge something (even €250-500/month) to ensure commitment. Calculate unit economics: customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), aim for LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1+. Price based on value delivered, not just cost. Start higher than you think - you can always discount. Test pricing with early customers and iterate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between a pilot and a paying customer?",
        "answer": "A pilot is a trial period (typically 4-12 weeks) where customers test your product, usually at reduced pricing or for free. A paying customer pays full or near-full price for ongoing usage. Pilots should have clear success metrics and timelines for conversion to paid. The best pilots include some payment (€250-500) to demonstrate commitment. Aim to convert 50%+ of pilots to paying customers within 3 months."

    ],
    "common_challenges": [
      {
        "question": "What are common reasons startups struggle in the program?",
        "answer": "Common challenges: Insufficient customer validation (building before talking to 50+ customers), weak traction (no paying customers or LOIs after 8 weeks), unclear differentiation (me-too product in crowded market), team issues (co-founder conflicts, skill gaps, poor cohesion), poor execution (slow iteration, missed milestones), and unrealistic market sizing or go-to-market strategy. The most critical is failing to demonstrate paying customer traction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if I should pivot?",
        "answer": "Consider pivoting when: customers consistently don't see value in your solution after 30+ conversations, you can't get design partners or paying customers after 2-3 months of outreach, your team lacks passion or domain expertise for the problem, the market is too small or declining, or you discover a bigger problem during customer interviews. Discuss pivots early with the Pioneers team - they can provide guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm falling behind the cohort?",
        "answer": "If you're behind: identify the specific gap (customer conversations? Product? Traction?), prioritize ruthlessly - focus only on activities that lead to paying customers, book office hours with the Pioneers team for guidance, leverage the cohort for intros and feedback, and set aggressive but achievable weekly goals. Many successful teams have slow starts but accelerate later. The key is demonstrating momentum and learning velocity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I balance product development and customer acquisition?",
        "answer": "Effective balancing: Dedicate 50% of time to customer conversations and sales outreach (this is your primary job), 30% to product development based on customer feedback, and 20% to fundraising prep, team building, and learning. Don't go silent on customers while building - keep them engaged with updates. Ship small iterations weekly rather than waiting for perfection. Customer feedback should drive product decisions."
