      "Slack Instruction & Email Commu": "Hey Everyone @channel,\nIt’s Decision Time!!!\nThis was very hard decision to make as we’ve been working alongside you for a long time and have developed affinities with each team. Also, we can make mistakes – companies we’ve rejected in the past have gone to be great companies!\nSo….. After careful evaluation and deliberations with Hugo and the Pioneers team, the following startups have been selected for the Investment Committee:\nUmamy\nMirmi\nJooobAI\nAvaHome\nFitBot\nGovIntel\nA reminder of the Selection criteria (in order of importance):\nExecution – GTM traction and product progress\nTeam – background, cohesion, and founder-product fit\nMarket – size and potential\n What’s next:\nOffice Hours: For the teams not moving forward, we’re hosting a feedback session starting at 3pm at the Hogwarts Room next to our space. Please text @Niklas - Pioneers Team  to book your slot.\nWe do realise that some teams are too early in their adventure and need a bit more time (August timing wasn’t great): we are forecasting to host one more IC in about a month – if you show traction, reach out to us. Any team in the sprint phase is eligible.\nPost-IC For those not advancing: you may stay at Station F until the end of November, but since you’re not officially in the program anymore, you would need to cover the cost your seat (€259 + VAT/month/per seat). You all may stay at the Pioneers space until Monday without additional cost.\nAnd ofcourse: you are now part of the Pioneers alumni community meaning you will be invited to our events, workshops and will be fasttracked for consideration for future cohorts :muscle:\nNow it’s time for the remaining teams to rock it during the IC this Friday, let’s go!!!!\n\n\nHugo's follow-on message: \n\nHey Everyone,\nI just want to take a moment to say how proud you can be of what you’ve accomplished so far. Whether you’re moving forward to the IC or not, this is just one step in a much longer journey.\nAs far as I know, building a company is a marathon with many ups and downs; today’s decision doesn’t define your future. What matters is the grit, creativity, and persistence you bring to the adventure. Keep pushing, keep learning, and remember that every milestone (even the tough ones) is part of building something truly meaningful.\nWe’re rooting for all of you!\n",

Good luck!\n:date: Format:\nEach team will pitch in front of the investment committee.\nFormat: 3 min pitch + 5 min Q&A.\nYour pitch should clearly cover: problem, solution, market, traction (or strong signals), team, and roadmap.\nEach team will be assigned a slot and will only join the session on their slot.\nIt is possible to pitch remotely\n-> This is the culmination of 8 weeks of work.

Evaluating your progress wasn’t easy. We faced several edge cases, and early-stage investing is, by definition, shaped by subjective judgment.\nA note to those not selected:\nDon’t let this stop you, keep building. We’re fully aware that we can make mistakes. Also, some of the best founders I backed at Hook had pitched to us multiple times before getting an investment. You remain part of the Pioneers community and and we’ll be keeping an eye on your progress.\nTo the selected teams:\nThis is far from a win. You’ve cleared a checkpoint but there’s still a long way to go to be investment-ready for the IC. There were no clear yes and you’ll all need to seriously accelerate execution and focus on validating core assumptions.\nNext steps:\n:date: Office Hours – Tomorrow, 11:00–13:00\nWe’ll be available tomorrow to answer questions. Feel free to ask about the decision-making, and share your honest feedback with us to help us improve.\n:wave: Outboarding on Tuesday\nFor those not continuing in the sprint phase, we’ll outboard you on Tuesday. You can always come back for a meeting, and we will send you an invite.\n:beers:For tonight\nLet’s celebrate the past weeks together over drinks - you’ve earned it!\n:speech_balloon: Slack & alumni community:\nFor those not selected, you remain part of the Pioneers community and we will invite you to events in the next months (stay tuned for a get-together after IC in September with the batch + friends).\nPlease also stay active with us on Slack, and let us know whenever the community can support you. Thank you again for your dedication and openness throughout this journey so far.\nSee you all this evening!\nBelow are the Selection Day results and the list of teams moving forward to the Sprint Phase.",

You now need to pivot, and the faster, the better.\nYour options:\nHard Pivot (changing the core of the business):\nNew customer segment\nNew core problem\nNew solution or product\nEntirely new market\nSoft Pivot (same direction, but refined):\nReframing the value prop, narrowing or expanding the user persona\nReworking the channel or go-to-market\nChanging the feature focus\nWhatever path you’re on, this week is about building clarity and making bold, informed moves.\nYou’re expected NOT to get things right.
