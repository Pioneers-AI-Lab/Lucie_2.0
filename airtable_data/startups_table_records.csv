Early team changes — Gabriel left, Arthur joined from another team. Current structure: Zac (CEO/sales), Tomas (CTO – PhD ML), Arthur (product), Jules (CEO role testing). Still aligning on roles, no equity agreements yet. Strong early impression but later flagged for lack of quantified customer learnings.

Aug 5: Office hours. Customer discovery: ~100 cold calls, 15 logistics companies engaged (5 large, 10 SMEs). Prospects include FM Logistic, Andros, XPO, Group Rota. Two staffing agencies committed as contract partners. Marketplace model with 50% margin on full-service (supply + demand) validated. Goal: first transactions by end of month. YC application submitted.

Aug 8: Pitch. Positioned as unified database for blue-collar workers. MVP: predicting no-shows and real-time worker replacement. Highlighted logistics case study (30% no-shows costing €2M/year). US market focus announced (San Francisco launch).

Aug 15: Pitch. Reframed as AI hiring system for staffing agencies. Value: reducing placement time from days to minutes by automating sourcing and matching.

Aug 29: Pitch. Positioned as AI recruiter automating candidate search/outreach (4 hours → minutes). Traction: new design partner signed, 25 potential customers contacted, pipeline of 1000 agencies identified. Feedback from Salomon: good presentation, but crowded market — will need stronger traction before VC funding; offered introductions to Xfiner (acquired by Randstad).","Maxime's Comment":"PROS:

TEAM:
The 2 founders (Zack and Jules) have complementary personalities and are very aligned in their vision and way of working. 
They also present well and are outspoken. 
Zac has strong experience with Blue-collar workers in his previous experience. (he's the ex-COO of Bold, and founder of La Tournée)

EXECUTION:
During the program they showed a good capacity to question themselves and their positioning. (They have pivoted on their solution 3-4 times)
Within the program: they closed a design partnership with a big interim company with a annual contract value of 25k EUR.

CONS:

TEAM:
Lost 2 CTO -cofounders during the program, which is an \"orange\" flag in their capacity to attract and keep strong talent.

EXECUTION:
Pivoted too many times which shows a lack of market clarity which resulted in not shipping any product during the program.

MARKET:
Their new positioning (Full-stack AI-agency play) might hinder their chances of subsequent VC funding due to challenging scalability.

The market complexity:
- Country-specific - hard for scaling (However, the data sources are European).

TEAM:
Quality team background (ex-Google employees having worked on consumer-facing products)
Charismatic CEO

TRACTION:
Good Sales traction and momentum: Within 6 weeks, they managed to be in advanced discussions with 6-7 gym networks representing +/- 4.5m users (thereof one commitment from BasicFit) and 2 influencers with +4m users.

CONS:

TEAM:
CTO is not full-stack - doesn't ship very fast which resulted in first launch only after 2 months of developing (Product execution risk).

MARKET:
Low potential defensibility (although working on blood sampling).
Red Ocean market with many players.

Feedback from Salomon: strong website, but needs demo video; must focus on retention/churn and HR tool integrations (e.g. Personio, HiBob) to be credible at scale.","Maxime's Comment":"PROS:

TEAM:
CEO is a repeat-entrepreneur: Stephane has launched several companies with respectable outcomes (million+ revenues and several small exits)
They have a complimentary team.

EXECUTION:
They pivoted several times in the HR space and have now found a somewhat convincing/differentiated entry point.
Strong sales capacity: within 2 months they managed to sign several \"high-profile\" tech scaleups already such as Sorare and Timeleft.

CONS:

TEAM:
- CEO just had a baby and is based is now based in Biarritz, they will be working remotely half of the time.
- Team is too big for an early stage company (4 members including a head of Sales/CSO), CEO seems to act sometimes as a manager rather than a founder.

MARKET:
- HR market is notoriously hard as it's a red ocean.","Committee":"Go"}},{"id":"recNCKA9PBFfUQm2u","createdTime":"2025-07-22T14:11:00.000Z","fields":{"Startup":"ThirdPlace","Team Members":["recibD5fOJHhEU7FZ"],"Startup in a word":"The AI social compass matching you to your people AND your plans.","Active / inactive":["Selection Day No Go"],"Previous Decks":[{"id":"attZUQx2MI9gorwiv","url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/EjJnSnNlv8Q1royWrWKoeg/otgKD3WJwGgOo4q6COfXzmS7Xa9Iasbwebxt9xIYD4XTYuvottUbwp4Z7DcHltw8KadVn_R47mxkCILvyBrg_53v1h3E6Xt2w_vqsA6kTrdBz8yZjlp66Lt9BW9xyEbAm-ZXe9BE23EsuoEGFny3D8dQvztQXtGJIVaIBpR6KeA5plABWgR2XfH29qfy8uix/aESKEI-XYacZV57Ms_oI0iYpOYwwHy4hhbrx0KX2U0g","filename":"thirdplace pitchdeck 27_07.pdf","size":6505063,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/iqFoitVo3AdOBGZhOK9kKA/ggifFKoojMAC40dKRcGwi12vj_-QW9M11NTRg9p5NizHGvqIhlrt82cKUC9YxyP2fKFSXOFpdBM2qcnsibQuy1zRT6wSNqmC9_NBIuiK1KvFvkN4R_5FNrYtjOle-eciEIdJ7e0-i54rTFgNrtYcFw/c7BtixyfUUcn9ke5n13jQMhnsoBmWf7u4Rj9bWK5HC4","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/gsX7WFt94HHeKGqvTnWIeg/3Dr2VgeSQ3f8O9pJYK7uIYpc_oQ2DyVa3pc1YMfMtB03Gf_ngbi_qVmMWdDI-Im4U2fYjsE53sizLFrR9xCje4-ggnZn6IZDQw0Cej6WduIt-rN3Bodh9ldkIYLBumkmEOlZa27yXTe4sZP1ZOY4Tw/Bj6zPAoMJmVh41keQrszprauq2FjTbKs_8oIyjQoAqA","width":910,"height":512}}}],"Startup Evaluation":["rec1y8YDR7ZJuaWJq","recijJyn1blv65jlv","recZohkFrINFSaJdi","recbBVm0gxmdyQ2II"],"Pitch Sequence":"8"}},{"id":"recQpVpn9qPUBTeJi","createdTime":"2025-07-17T09:52:26.000Z","fields":{"Startup":"Orchly","Weekly forms":["recrghQToSJLUOHIW","recw45jin20bJgFZA","recx3744yTjpcMyAK","recsn9EbVYWrZnEUo","recz1BxTWJAqeVJFC","recgOO2cZiGNsqBDs"],"Team Members":["recSt2IAYyrlpGH9W","recuCYxmlOQvGuFM1","rec2hx9iqGVaWlCXb"],"Startup in a word":"The DevOps copilot that resolves incidents in minutes","Notes":["recOkboFFbmyLHJwF","recywt1yp9U4FrwtP","recQ5KFWdAfx35uFw"],"Previous Decks":[{"id":"attnpaLx5lUn3ndLv","url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/dTzzTArpL9d2_kNF_9BSVQ/vBHcXrJwRWc17lUbkYJrQK835QHtUXHD_bi2hBEpVE3f9psq84IdguJDq4YKHyjLJnnp3Fq48LyGNcfuA0Wlgpp5QzJXWCY_YCkm-LnYt0HX2dQ2NStcdAlsziyVCwJNTsPiAbQCquJAz9D6WaXoWfsFyx1-BVpxh-qbf7fpmoY/jX4MMUmVflZ1RkOlQlw7dtx1JMk6ugDDuOD4q4P9VLo","filename":"Orchly Pitch Deck (3).pdf","size":4576984,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/5MzJt5QQOoHsx7lV8hJFEA/qG5POxydMKQXTjKqP8srU356JfvkWGS5gMNuNODNuZUbImLPO7yOG5UnVEkQr4ge7s-Gmk1JkIZhLB8e1wwZojV0AyhB7C6eDN2qLTIbgq343wPGT5ugKyIQZBm3vxuXTBzWAXjjDj_GFOk17-GINg/Q4hJZgBKKCAz2AYnbdw_EEsNUtdMU1PFfSjfUzAfQjY","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/IlEr6H9XHqOGZQ0FVN6RhQ/1lg6YdMReWbgziyw56cxSys7EecyyBjQSfwnaUk2vRkzrq5aQLY_8fGPqLOBVc6-mvmvX92CYICcI9OsKWOw_Um3WzAw4cmdv7eLZaom6KfjennlNUB6wNlr8cKmQ6xEgGM68VO2pbxp-OOLocjrCg/JiDdChvINrocEYfXVY1kEptzPNtJ-UyL3zcE5rin4X4","width":910,"height":512}}}],"Startup Evaluation":["reciGdrPCtlwqeH4i","reccUK4FkRvIiTUsX","rec7XkWugUJh5cetW","recj2RvVHkFl8Y0JP","recgtCTPDxjYBpJ2F","rec4W3UPdlb0XyuK9"],"Pitch Sequence":"6","Industry":["DevTools"],"Traction Summary":"🚀 Traction summary

Aug 8: First pitch. Problem framed as legal research chaos (10+ logins, 20+ tabs). Solution: browser-controlling AI agent. Early traction: 54 outreach emails (44% click rate), 1 waitlist signup, 60k lawyer database available. Ambition: build 4 tools/month.

Aug 15: Pitch. Reframed as “Stripe for legal research,” emphasizing infrastructure for AI agents by 2030. Progress: 6 waitlist signups, iterating on landing page. Strong founder credibility noted, but product positioning unclear (prosumer vs infrastructure). Feedback: need sharper articulation of target customer and approach.

Aug 22: Pitch. MVP nearing launch. Positioning still too technical (“SERP Firecrawl API”) and lacked clear lawyer connection. Learning: lawyers want immediate interaction with a UI, not just infrastructure. MVP private beta scheduled for Monday.

Aug 29: Pitch. Progress: 7 tools launched, background credibility with 48K-user Good Legal. Signed design partnership with established legal publisher (founded 1612): €30k creation fee + €10k/year maintenance with credit-sharing model. Market framed as €850B legal tooling space, currently dominated by human effort. Feedback from Salomon: strong pain/solution framing, good vision, but slides need stronger visuals for investor impact.","Maxime's Comment":"PROS:

TEAM:
By far the most hardworking and consistent team (always the earliest team in the office and last to leave).
The only team that share their weekly updates without reminders.
Great synergy - They are aligned on the vision and they get along very well.

EXECUTION:
High shipping velocity: they have launched over 70 features in 3 months after constant contact with customers.
Good traction: they've acquired 45 users, on 750 listings, and 3k MRR in less than 3 months.


CONS:
Complex market to achieve fast growth.
Unclear path to billion dollar business.","Committee":"Go"}}]}
