      "Problem": "I want to solve the problem of C-suite executives drowning in noise by building a specialized AI model that acts like a role-aware research analyst. Starting with crypto — where I’ve worked as a research analyst and know the highest-signal data sources — the model ingests on-chain activity, ETF flows, governance proposals, and regulatory updates, then delivers a five-minute, role-specific brief: what happened, why it matters for their function, and one action to consider. The biggest thing I’ve learned is that decision-makers don’t need more data — they need the right data, presented frictionlessly, so they can act with confidence. This product systematically improves as we interview executives, refine prompts, and tune outputs, then scales across other high-velocity information industries (AI, fintech, biotech) using the same playbook. Upsells include custom-trained models for even more precise insight targeting, but the core value is consolidating what’s already out there into clear, actionable takeaways. This hits all the Lab’s criteria: prosumer focus, AI as the value engine, product-led viral growth through Slack/Teams sharing, and direct monetization via per-seat subscriptions.",

Melanie didn't start as a tech CEO or had tech background, as a teacher at a university she was experiencing first-hand how much overcomplexity and friction existed in the current landscape of design tools, limiting their access. She was aware of the pain and envisioned an experience where designing was quick, easy and accessible. Started with a simple tool that took off which opened up the door to further impact. With no connections, no technical background and no flashy titles as Ex-Something and away of Silicon Valley's hub, she landed investment from Bill Tai because her vision was clear. She wanted Canva to do for design what Google did for search. Instead of going for the obvious pool of user's that Adobe was already serving Canva targeted everyone else, tapping into a massive under-served market. Simple product with drag-and-drop and freemium model destroyed any potential barriers for user's engagement. With millions of users and a valuation peaking at 40 billion she became one of the youngest self-made billionaires without following the well-walked noisy path many choose to follow. What I truly admire most is how truly impact driven the founders have been by pleading donating 30% of the company's value to social impact causes. ",
