Scouted and supported over 20,000 startups for corporate partners across multiple tech verticals.
Tripled lead generation in 6 months through fractional C-level roles, driving GTM execution and cross-border expansion in Europe.
Led strategic partnerships and commercial growth, managing 30+ sponsors and 100+ speakers at a tech summit.","What I am interested in working on:":"Problem I'm currently working on solving: Young borrowers under 30 face systematic barriers within European credit scoring systems that stem from the fundamental design of traditional risk assessment methodologies. The emphasis on historical credit performance and established financial relationships inherently disadvantages individuals who have had limited time to develop comprehensive credit histories or accumulate substantial assets that serve as collateral or demonstrate financial stability.

With major players such as Schufa Holding AG, Experian, and other commercial listed companies controlling significant portions of European credit information systems, young borrowers who have primarily engaged with alternative financial services or maintained minimal traditional banking relationships may find their creditworthiness inadequately represented in standard assessment processes.

Solution: Behavioral credit scoring represents a paradigm shift in financial risk assessment, leveraging non-traditional data sources to evaluate creditworthiness. This approach analyzes patterns in digital transactions, social media interactions, mobile usage, and other behavioral indicators to complement or replace traditional metrics like payment history and debt-to-income ratios. In Europe, where 22% of adults lack access to traditional credit products, behavioral scoring offers potential solutions for financial inclusion while introducing complex regulatory considerations under evolving EU frameworks.","T-Shirt Size":"S","Introduction:":"Hi, I'm Tea.

After my studies I worked as a Product Manager at ForePaaS, a startup in the cloud/data/ML space. There, I led the development of multiple products and I shaped our product management division ultimately contributing to the startup’s acquisition by the OVHcloud. 
At OVH, I led a few AI product efforts, however, corporate work felt like wasting my life, so I quit to start my own startup. 
Last year, I co-founded BrodAI, an AI agent company to automate SEO marketing for e-commerce SMBs. I was CTO and I coded the entire stack: the AI agent, the backend, the frontend and the associated infrastructure. 
In just a couple of months, we had a functional SEO AI agent, our first paying e‑commerce customers and a pre‑seed term sheet from a venture capital fund. 
Before we signed it however, my co‑founder decided to step back for personal reasons.

My technical background spans over five years of hands-on experience working with Linux, C++, Python, Rust, ROS, FastAPI, and Docker. I have a strong foundation in robotics perception, motion planning, and infrastructure development.

Born in India, now based in Paris (my 5th country after stints in Singapore, Dubai, and briefly the US). My journey started early: I wrote my first lines of C++ at 8, and by 11, I was interning at my first startup — debugging, shipping, and falling in love with building. That love never left.

Over the years, I’ve built and scaled products and tech teams from scratch, wearing every startup hat — from writing backend code to pitching investors. I’m a technical founder at heart, with deep expertise in distributed systems and high-throughput platforms. I can code 0 to 1, and scale processes and teams from 1 to 100.

I have a hustler–builder bias. While I’ve done pre-sales, led teams, shipped code, hired and fired, and handled operations, tech, and business strategy - I am at my best building products. I believe in fast iterations, staying uncomfortable, and surrounding myself with people who raise the bar.

PS:
While I have led and can do web app development, understand and build mobile apps - my current strengths are in building data platforms, web services (backend), infra setup and automation, designing scalable architectures and multiple clouds. 

I am very impact driven. I plan to aim high, build something of value for others while generating value for myself. I have had the most joy when others tell me they love what I have built and this motivates me.","Founder":["rec7BYeJHPUbDtD44"],"In a team":"no"}},{"id":"reckTozzqhCR5G6Ru","createdTime":"2025-05-26T23:39:36.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Connor Blair","Status":"Yes, I am available full time.","Whatsapp":"+19522177258","Email":"connor@manateelabsusa.com","Your photo":[{"id":"att7xwsXknrmZQRdQ","width":5184,"height":3456,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/Hrr3Uf8ALuXbEJtCD7TbjA/Nn-Br5Onwg0glMD64MQuwFCxqmzliQTmrA6GObsuQ4aCjLVgzP08Eg-n6_CdjZJSREIZW0KC1KddiZ83XbUpOpY1F7vHC_kGzyIwh_9slmr10566lXQKxagf46H2Uqw1vUiRzISjBYNtj6lZVEqHbJOOvWh_sbxymMASTyt7mhc/MuB7JEPWJ4KXBlRSZb01I2EwV5W4hii3K-sHWFJuOSs","filename":"cblair.jpg","size":5051035,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/o2RVqe2K7d1qOGKQC6wpKQ/dN_HDpD4qP_FkB1frdJ24MH4rN4VjMQZITGfnfVEvUn41Dglv5IYhyNtqRptU53gOAsbHQYRSpmfZ14KmdGXYNxpKlVrL0L41s_xanjh7G03zvx13mP-MY8zn4v097yhSPJJ8d0PPUKoAwy6kqvCXQ/WruZfz3F6AT-6m3ys5RVi4npBUNhXgsLXjZVFsG5_zw","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/Q_kL0vlW31NeJestfeR7iw/7I_73cWdaPS2xMG-ZQzD8lIEUuA1ZQuqQJgk-n52RFCdmWIR8romZyvFtPnkXU9VZEXGXXRfZcR_r4SmOAsFWFBIxGsMMPzhteDDV_9O3lijZyHIDW01AoIoMWNe5MyZWwrKRVE8_FlxcRolCcSWRQ/eEYXj8yhVFJp7flb5MGRIZmFP8-ab4ejDTF5R-i693Y","width":768,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/49/49/1768046400000/-u8gF1bfbe21zgsgYL68sQ/3Z7jeSKF46lIHW3-x19_QCTWxdn0tuYAAQ5v9y8pgca6xuKX3WeJ8hASI6LZVK1Yg2THayV377uj7HULxbno_lSd_Lx-V3btMxgBRrYBN1-jrEfXNO9utsdY8XbMeMJpyXsjWc8JQI7GBfypzVwVvQ/1xuAVvLf88kz3bKKjREFy0LU6I7xSmejTOSzwJmCwLk","width":3000,"height":2000}}}],"Do you have an existing project/idea ?":"Yes","Are you open to join another project during the program?

Became the biggest multigaming community on computer. 
- Former CTO of the CNJE (National Confederation of French Junior-Entreprises). > 100k budget, > 25k end-users
- 2 years as Product Engineer in a start-up studio : built start-up / product in 5 weeks. AI‑ERP for a top insurer, storytelling toy box (raised €10 M), self‑charging bus, etc.

I like to see myself as a tech \"couteau-suisse\".  I've built my experience to draw a thin line between deep tech knowledge and the ability to translate business into requirements. 

At 15, I've built my first company : an e-sport team with a community agency. (That's where the \"Counter-strike competitor\" comes from).

During my studies, I've became president of the Junior-Entreprise (consulting association) of my engineering school, and then became CTO of the french confederation of Junior-Entreprise. (20k end users, 100k budget, and I've been multiple time speaker in front of >1.5 people). 

Worked at the most important energy company of the country. Horrible experience, but learned quite a bit. 

Then joined Sparkmate, a start-up studio that aims to ship company in 5 weeks, whatever the subject. Worked on an AI-powered ERP for top insurance company, a children story telling box powered by AI (start-up raised > 10M), a bus that recharges while moving, fencing shoes.  

Then I became sick. 

Recovered, then left the company. Built my own one. Failed it. (hopefully, what an experience it was!).
