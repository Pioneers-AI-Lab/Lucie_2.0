Airbnb redefined access, community, and belonging — turning idle capacity into meaningful human and economic value. It transformed a simple consumer behavior (staying somewhere) into a global movement built on trust, design, and technology.

This story resonates deeply with me because I’ve lived a parallel journey with Leavy.co, which empowered the same new generation of travelers and hosts through digital inclusion. Airbnb’s ability to blend tech scalability with authentic human connection—while navigating regulatory, financial, and societal challenges—is a masterclass in strategic resilience and purpose-driven growth.

Most independent workers spend hours issuing invoices, chasing late payments, and navigating complex tax systems that weren’t designed for digital or cross-border work. The process is inefficient, error-prone, and excludes millions of people who can’t afford accountants/lawyers or don’t understand local regulations.

I want to use AI to make this invisible. Imagine a system where a freelancer simply messages a bot (On Whatapp, Telegram, Signal; or even via a simple SMS) — “Send invoice to X for €500” — and the AI automatically generates a compliant invoice, verifies client data through public registries, and processes payment via stablecoins. The funds would be instantly and transparently split between the freelancer and the tax authorities, creating a seamless, compliant transaction in real time. (I already have the right ties with the relevant public institutions in France) 

*This solution is very much inspired by my time spent in Africa and working indirectly with M-Pesa and its partners.","⁠⁠First users":"I’d start by identifying a small community that already feels the pain my product solves, for example, freelancers struggling with invoicing or creatives wanting to automate tedious workflows.

’d start with people who already know and trust me, say freelancers in Paris, and onboard them manually, collecting feedback one-on-one. When the product feels like it was built for them, they’ll naturally share it. I’d then publish 3–4 authentic user stories: short videos or posts showing how the tool saved time or simplified real work. People don’t adopt new tech because it’s “AI”, they adopt it because it makes life easier. I would probably then try to leverage niche online spaces such as Reddit, Discord, and Telegram groups are where early adopters live. I’d join conversations genuinely (not pitch) and share the tool when it fits naturally. We want at this point that our early users become our most passionate ambassadors.
I would later run a simple referral loop, where early users would get a small reward, like a feature unlock, for each friend who joins. It’s cheap, measurable, and compounds fast if the product really works. 

The thing to keep in mind here is to focus on retention before expansion : I’d spend the first few weeks understanding why users come back (or don’t). Once 100 people are using it regularly and loving it, the next 900 come easier, through iteration, not ads.

I’d get to the first 1,000 users without spending on ads, just by creating something real, useful, and shareable.","Favorite startup":"I’d say M-Pesa in Africa.

It started as a simple way to transfer mobile credit in Kenya and ended up redefining what financial inclusion could look like. What’s amazing is that while banks were wondering how to evolve their digital products, people on the ground were already using M-Pesa to build a whole financial ecosystem (paying school fees, sending remittances, running businesses, and so on), all from basic mobile phones.

It showed that innovation doesn’t always come from high tech, it comes from solving real problems in the simplest, most accessible way possible.","About us":"Email","⁠⁠Refer":"No one in particular right now","Solo team":"team","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"Yes","Notes":"?"}},{"id":"rec3RXTRfD1An1etJ","createdTime":"2025-10-31T14:44:28.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Mathis","Last name":"Maunick","Email":"mathis.maunick@gmail.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathis-maunick/","Whatsapp":"+33 6 02 61 89 69","Skills":"My profile is built on three pillars: Product Strategy, Tech-Agnostic Execution, and Entrepreneurial Grit.

1. Product Strategy (Learned from my AI Agency):
My AI agency was my training ground. I learned firsthand how to translate ambiguous client problems into concrete technical roadmaps. I managed everything from initial scoping and stakeholder alignment to final delivery. This experience, combined with my ESSEC business degree, taught me how to find the real problem and define the right product to build.

2. Tech-Agnostic Execution (Learned as an Engineer):
My years as a Data Engineer taught me to master foundational principles, not just specific tools. Today, I leverage LLMs as powerful learning accelerators, which allows me to become productive in any required technology stack in days, not months. This removes technical limits and lets me focus on building the best solution, fast. I architect and code myself.

3. Entrepreneurial Execution (Learned from my Supplement Brand):
Launching a food supplement brand from scratch taught me the skills not covered in engineering school: sales, go-to-market strategy, supply chain management, and pure resilience. I built the growth engine and acquired the first customers with zero budget. This proves I can build not just a product, but a self-sustaining business.","Problem":"My ambition is to solve the critical problem of brand invisibility in the post-search era. I want to build the tools that allow companies to control how they are portrayed by AI, ensuring they are cited as the primary source of truth in their domain instead of being replaced by a competitor.

The Problem: A Silent Traffic Extinction
We are shifting from a \"Search\" paradigm of scanning links to an \"Ask\" paradigm of getting an instant answer. If leading AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini don’t know a brand or can't trust its data, it simply vanishes for the user. This is not just about losing SEO clicks; it's about being erased from consideration.

The Market: A Multi-Billion Dollar Shift
This isn't a niche problem. It's a massive, emerging market. Analysts already value the Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) market at nearly $1 billion for 2025, with forecasts showing it will explode to over $30 billion by 2034. This is the budget that will shift from traditional SEO as companies realize their old playbook is obsolete.

The Solution: A GEO Platform
I envision a SaaS platform that allows companies to:

1 - Measure: Quantify their citation frequency by major AI models on key topics against their competitors.
2 - Diagnose: Pinpoint the semantic weaknesses that cause AIs to ignore them, such as unstructured data or low-trust signals.
3 - Optimize: Generate \"knowledge capsules\", content blocks formatted specifically for LLMs to easily cite and reuse.","⁠⁠First users":"I know exactly how I'll get my first 1,000 users. My strategy isn't about hope. It's a machine built to turn apathy into urgency by showing undeniable proof.

First, I create demand with data. This will bring in 300 users.
I’ll start by building an engine that audits thousands of brands. It will find every instance where an AI recommends their competitor over them. With this proof, I'll send hyper-personalized alerts to 2,000 key decision-makers with a single, powerful screenshot showing their brand being erased. This isn’t a sales email. It’s a critical alert they can’t ignore. Getting a 15% response is a clear and repeatable path to the first 300 motivated users.

Next, I build a viral loop. This will bring in 400 users.
I’ll take that data and make it public with the \"AI Visibility Index\". This isn't just a blog post. It's a public leaderboard that taps directly into ego and fear. Winners will share their success. Losers will come directly to me to fix their rank. This becomes a powerful loop of social proof that brings in the next 400 users.

Finally, the product itself pulls people in. This will bring in 300+ users.
The product itself becomes the main driver of growth. A free, instant audit tool on the homepage will let anyone see their risk score. This isn’t a simple gimmick. It’s our best salesperson, working 24/7 to convert visitors into the next 300+ users.

This is more than a plan. It's a growth flywheel. Each part fuels the next. The proof creates the first users. The index turns them into viral stories. The free tool captures all the new demand. It’s a system designed to deliver 1,000 motivated early adopters who already know they need us before they even sign up.","Favorite startup":"My favorite success story is Le Petit Ballon. Their genius was not in selling wine, but in solving the universal anxiety of choosing it.

They understood that for millions, the real friction was not access to wine but the psychological barrier of the wine aisle. The fear of making a bad choice leads to analysis paralysis, so people buy the same \"safe\" bottle every time. It’s a huge, unaddressed emotional market.

Their solution was a subscription box curated by a top sommelier. This was an elegant masterstroke in user experience. It outsourced the risk of choice and transformed a moment of anxiety into one of discovery and delight. The subscription model is brilliant not just for recurring revenue. It also builds a ritual, turning a simple transaction into an anticipated monthly experience.

This model allowed them to build a loyal community of over 150,000 subscribers. More importantly, they demystified an intimidating category. Through their tasting notes and magazine, they made wine knowledge accessible and enjoyable, never snobbish.

They didn't just sell a product. They created a more confident and educated customer base.

For me, Le Petit Ballon is the perfect example of a startup that achieved massive success by focusing on the human emotion behind the purchase, not just the product itself.","About us":"linkedin","⁠⁠Refer":"Yes, without hesitation: Paul Bordes, my co-founder in our food supplement brand.

We change every day, but it’s still hard to move forward without some sense of direction.
I use AI daily: to plan my diet, reflect on my mindset, and stay balanced. I’m 27, and each day I try to understand myself better and make smarter decisions. Recently, I thought about my younger brother, who’s 19. He has something I didn’t at his age: someone who knows him well and can guide him. Many young people don’t have that kind of support.
Even though AI supports me daily, it still lacks the depth and empathy of a human mentor. That’s why I started imagining an AI-powered platform that connects people with the right mentor for them - someone who truly fits their goals, mindset, and personality.
In a world where AI already helps us with everyday choices, I believe it could also help us find the right people to guide us: to give us purpose and direction when we need it most.","⁠⁠First users":"If I were to launch the AI consumer product described above, my go-to-market plan would focus on building traction locally first and expanding once we find product-market fit. I’d start with:
-Local GTM: focus on one city or community to build density and word-of-mouth before scaling.
-High-value mentors: onboard a few top-tier mentors (founders, ex–top-tier professionals) to attract users. To involve them early, I’d offer small equity shares or paid collaborations.
-University partnerships: offer access to the platform so students can benefit from mentorship.
-Social media strategy: share educational and storytelling content to attract both mentors and mentees.
-Ambassador program: reward users with credits for every friend they invite.

To reach the first 1,000 users:
-1 mentor with ~10k followers and 5% conversion = 500 users
-1 university partnership, 3k students at 5% conversion = 150 users
-Organic social content = 200 users
-18% of 850 users inviting one friend = 150 new users

This would bring us to the first 1,000 users.","Favorite startup":"A great example for me is Airbnb.

As a founder, I’ve built and operated a food-tech startup in India, giving me hands-on insight into the HoReCa and retail sectors.

Tech skills: Product Management, API Platforms, Food Tech, Automation, Cloud Integrations, and emerging expertise in AI applications.

Core skills: Team Leadership, Strategic Partnerships, Retail Operations, Brand Building, Data-Driven Decision Making, and Go-To-Market Strategy.","Problem":"While running my food tech brand, I realized how important personalization has become for modern consumers. Today, people rely heavily on Google Maps or generic review apps to decide where to eat or drink — but these platforms aren’t designed for personal taste, mood, or context.

I want to solve this problem by building an AI-driven discovery experience that understands each user’s unique preferences and creates hyper-personalized recommendations for cafés, restaurants, local wines, breweries, and experiences in any city/location they visit. Current discovery methods are a lot of hops for a user where they need to search and manually narrow down on their search themselves. This can be more intuitive, proactive and in much lesser hops for the user. 

Using AI, data, and a generative interface(generative UI), the goal is to make finding your next great local experience(activity, cafe, drinks, food or anything else) feel effortless and uniquely “you.”","⁠⁠First users":"I’d start by launching in one city like Paris — it’s the perfect test market, and I’m currently based here. The focus would be on coffee and local food discovery, keeping the product hyper-niche and authentic. I’d partner with 10–15 high-footfall spots across key categories — cafés, wine bars, microbreweries, and restaurants — and list them as “founding partners.” Each would be requested to offer a small discovery reward (like 5–10% off) for visits made via the app, with tiered incentives to drive engagement.

To acquire the first 1,000 users, I’d focus on:

Organic storytelling — collaborating with local food bloggers, micro-influencers, and community pages to share “AI-curated city guides.” Each new user would answer a few questions to generate a personalized “Taste Map,” which they could share socially — creating built-in virality.

User-generated experiences — every shared map would highlight real Paris stories and curated visits, designed to be visually striking and social-media worthy.

Signup rewards — like a free coffee or drink when visiting a partner venue through the app, if referral partnerships aren’t in place.

Partnering with the walking tours - I'd partner with the walking tours so they can refer us end of their tours, and we will have some sign up incentives via the signups made from them.

Early adopters would come through curiosity and word-of-mouth — drawn by the promise of finding hidden gems that match their taste. Paris has that ripple effect where people go and tell their friends to visit — and I’d leverage that psychological behavior to drive organic followership.

Above are some generic ideas, and I would like to make a data driven decision. Do an MVP and assess and analyse what all techniques we should use in the pilot phase of growth and then build it up from there. ","Favorite startup":"My favorite consumer startup story is an indian startup named Zomato — because it started with something very real and relatable: helping people discover where to eat. What began as a simple menu-listing platform in Delhi grew into a global brand that changed how people experience food, reviews, and local dining culture.

While i was running my food tech business, I onboarded multiple my restaurants on Zomato and saw firsthand how it connected diners to local food but lacked true personalization. That experience made me realize how AI could create more intelligent, tailored discovery and create a next generation of a personalisation engine.

Zomato inspires me because it built trust through community, design, and storytelling — proving that solving a deeply local problem thoughtfully can scale globally.","About us":"Other","Solo team":"solo","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"what is","Other":"Social Media"}},{"id":"rec7doncyhjByqS4X","createdTime":"2025-10-13T19:46:17.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Bastien","Last name":"Riccio","Email":"bastien.riccio@brandye.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bastien-riccio/","Whatsapp":"+336664421055","Skills":"We’re a complementary team combining product vision, AI engineering, and growth execution.

I come from a computer science background, but I'm not your typical PM who writes specs and waits for engineers. I code, I ship, I lead teams.

Code I Write Daily:
- Swift (built OkiChat entirely myself - 4,000+ lines, native macOS app)
- Python (data pipelines, automation, backend services)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (web interfaces, API integrations)
- Infrastructure: Cloudflare (CDN, Workers), AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS), SQL databases

Products Launched:
- KardiaChain Wallet: 0→670K users, Vietnam's top blockchain wallet
- Ampverse Creator Platform: 100M+ views across 150+ gaming creators
- Ledger Blockchain Integrations: 4 highly complex blockchains, securing $millions in user assets

Why This Matters:
- I'm building in AI, but I understand privacy/security at infrastructure level
- I know what \"local-first\" actually means (not just marketing buzzword)
- I've worked in regulated industries - know how to build compliant products
- I understand economics: API pricing, subscription models, freemium conversion

I am a great communicator - I can pitch to VCs, explain tech to students, and create content for TikTok/Instagram - I can make complex tech feel simple

I know how to get shit done, and did I tell you that I am also exceptionally lucky.","Problem":"THE PROBLEM: AI/LLMs are Expensive, Fragmented, and Inaccessible

At some point of my life, I was paying almost €80/month for AI tools. ChatGPT Plus (€20), Claude Pro (€20), Cursor (€20), Perplexity (€20). 

But here's the absurd part: I barely use 20% of what I'm paying for. 

Why? Because:
- I switch between models constantly (GPT-4 for code, Claude for writing, Gemini for research)
- Each tool lives in a different tab, different login, different interface
- I'm paying for \"unlimited\" usage I'll never hit across 4 subscriptions
- My conversations are scattered across platforms (can't find that GPT-4 answer from last week)

I'm a power user. I know which model is best for what. I am reading papers and model releases. I follow AI Twitter. And even I'm getting ripped off.

Now imagine the other 95% of people:
- They've only heard of ChatGPT
- They don't know Claude exists (or why it's better for some tasks)
- They're paying €20/month for ChatGPT Plus, unaware they could get better answers from Gemini for free
- They don't know what \"local models\" are, or that they could run AI privately on their laptop

The problem isn't that people don't want to use AI - it's that the current landscape is:
1. Too expensive (€60-80/month for power users)
2. Too fragmented (5+ browser tabs, 5+ logins, 5+ billing cycles)
3. Too complicated (which model for what? API keys? Rate limits?)
4. Too risky (your company docs going to OpenAI's servers? Privacy nightmare)


THE CURRENT \"SOLUTIONS\" ARE BROKEN

When I realized I was burning €80/month, I looked for alternatives.

What I found:
- Developer-focused tools (LibreChat, Jan) - command line interfaces, zero design, meant for engineers
- Browser-based tools - slow, privacy concerns, janky UX, can't work offline
- \"All-in-one\" platforms - cloud-based (your data on their servers), expensive (€30-50/month), bloated features

That's why I decided to take matters into my own hands to prove you can make multi-model AI simple, private, and affordable.

So I built OkiChat - a native macOS app that solves all four problems:

Instead of explaining, here's a 2-minute demo:  https://www.loom.com/share/b9c1b5e520db41afaf43e6cc62909337 

Privacy-first (local storage, no cloud leakage)
Native Mac experience (fast, offline-capable, beautiful UI)
Multi-model access (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, local models in future - all in one place)
Stupidly affordable (€7/month)

THE BIGGER VISION: The App Store for AI Models

Here's what most people miss: The future is MULTI-MODEL.

What model is winning right now is not guaranteed to win in future. And you can clearly see in the LLMs leaderboard's rankings. Just in last two months, more than 20+ models were released. And things are going crazy, especially in the video generation models, which I also want to support.

People will need:
1. A way to ACCESS all these models (not 50 different subscriptions)
2. A way to DISCOVER which model to use (not trial-and-error across platforms)
3. A way to TRUST their data is safe (not scattered across 50 companies' servers)

OkiChat becomes the \"app store\" for AI:
- Browse models by capability (best for code, best for writing, best for math)
- One-click install (cloud or local)
- Unified billing (pay once, access everything)
- Privacy guaranteed (local-first architecture)


And I'm not just talking vision here. I'm literally building myself, been using it and within next week or so, I want to launch it.

https://oki.chat","⁠⁠First users":"Strategy: Start with students (my niche), then scale via content and community.


Why Students?
- I'm a student at HEC Paris - I understand this market intimately
- Students are early AI adopters (every CS/business major uses ChatGPT daily)
- They're price-sensitive (€20/month ChatGPT Plus is expensive on student budget)
- They're privacy-aware (don't want professors seeing their AI usage)
- They talk to each other (word-of-mouth spreads fast in universities)
- Geographic density (1,000+ students in one campus = efficient distribution)

Current Traction (Before Launch):
- 40-50 waitlist signups from word-of-mouth alone
- Social media momentum: 30-45K views/month across TikTok + Instagram
- DMs every week asking to test early versions
- Tech content channel already built (credibility in AI/tech space)

PHASE 1: FIRST 50 USERS (Week 1-2)
Strategy: Personal Network + Build in Public

   - Exclusive perks (lifetime discount, beta features)
   
 Referral program:
   - Give each power user 5 invite codes
   - \"Invite a friend, both get 1 month free\" (€7 value)

Campus activation (HEC Paris):
   - Flyers in classrooms/common areas: \"Get ChatGPT and more just for €7/month\"
   - Library study sessions: Approach students using ChatGPT, show them OkiChat
   - Class presentations: Partner with student clubs (tech society, AI club)
   - HEC Email outreach: I am Co-Head of Product Club so i can reach out to the entire HEC Email list

Social media push:
- Making \"BUILD IN PUBLIC\" series, already started: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQCqpvviLXm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
- Continue with tech chanel: https://www.instagram.com/abhifortech

PHASE 3: NEXT 350 USERS (Week 7-12)
Strategy: Campus Expansion + Community Partnerships

Replicate to 2-3 nearby universities:
   - Target: ESSEC, Sciences Po, Polytechnique (Paris tech/business schools)
   - Find 1 student ambassador per campus (give them free premium + €50 credit for pizza sessions)
   - Run playbook: Society partnerships → workshops → referral loop
   - Whatever worked in HEC, copies to other universities


PHASE 4: SCALING TO 1,000 USERS 
Campus ambassador program (scale to 10 campuses):
   - Recruit: 1 ambassador per university (free premium + €100/month budget)
   - Playbook: Society partnerships, workshops, referral competitions
   - Leaderboard: Top 3 ambassadors get bonus (Apple AirPods, OkiChat merch)

Content marketing (SEO + organic + Paid):
    - Reddit/Discord presence: r/ChatGPT, r/students, AI Discord servers
   - Share genuinely helpful tips, mention OkiChat where relevant
   - Instagram/TikTok ads targeted at university students (18-25, interests: AI, productivity)
   - Test creative: \"€7/month for ChatGPT\" + demo video
   - Goal: Learn unit economics (CAC, conversion rate)
   - If CAC < €5 and LTV > €20 (3 months retention), scale budget

Product Hunt launch (Week 8):
   - Prepare: 50+ users ready to upvote Day 1
   - Goal: #1 Product of the Day (drives 500-1000 visitors)
   - Convert 10-15% to signups (50-150 users)

PARALLEL ACTIVITIES (Throughout All Phases)

Social Media (Daily):
- TikTok/Instagram: AI news commentary Tech Channel, Product demos, tips, (5-7 posts/week)
- Instagram/LinkedIn: Build in public updates (1-3 posts/week)

Community Building:
- WhatsApp group for OkiChat users AI Focused (100-500 members)


The student market is a wedge. Once we dominate there, we expand to:
- Professionals (lawyers, doctors needing privacy)
- Small businesses (teams of 5-10)
- Enterprises (white-label OkiChat for companies) -> After working at Ledger, I have extremely clear idea on this also","Favorite startup":"I'd say Notion.

They launched when Evernote, Google Docs, Confluence owned the space. Everyone said that \"productivity tools are solved\" 

But notion bet on two things -> neatest User experience and knowledge workers were duct-taping together 5-6 tools (notes + docs + wikis + databases) because no single tool was flexible enough.

Their breakthrough wasn't better features - it was composability. Just like Lego blocks instead of fixed templates.

. On the company side, I’d reach out to 42’s existing hiring partners, offering a simple on boarding flow that converts their job offers into AI-generated challenges — replacing CVs with proof of skill.
. Each challenge naturally drives vitality: students share their results publicly, companies showcase their talent pipeline, and both sides reinforce each other’s engagement.

To acquire the first 1,000 users, I’d focus on:

Organic storytelling — collaborating with local food bloggers, micro-influencers, and community pages to share “AI-curated city guides.” Each new user would answer a few questions to generate a personalized “Taste Map,” which they could share socially — creating built-in virality.

User-generated experiences — every shared map would highlight real Paris stories and curated visits, designed to be visually striking and social-media worthy.

Signup rewards — like a free coffee or drink when visiting a partner venue through the app, if referral partnerships aren’t in place.

Partnering with the walking tours - I'd partner with the walking tours so they can refer us end of their tours, and we will have some sign up incentives via the signups made from them.

Early adopters would come through curiosity and word-of-mouth — drawn by the promise of finding hidden gems that match their taste. Paris has that ripple effect where people go and tell their friends to visit — and I’d leverage that psychological behavior to drive organic followership.

Above are some generic ideas, and I would like to make a data driven decision. Do an MVP and assess and analyse what all techniques we should use in the pilot phase of growth and then build it up from there. ","Favorite startup":"My favorite consumer startup story is an indian startup named Zomato — because it started with something very real and relatable: helping people discover where to eat. What began as a simple menu-listing platform in Delhi grew into a global brand that changed how people experience food, reviews, and local dining culture.

While i was running my food tech business, I onboarded multiple my restaurants on Zomato and saw firsthand how it connected diners to local food but lacked true personalization. That experience made me realize how AI could create more intelligent, tailored discovery and create a next generation of a personalisation engine.

Zomato inspires me because it built trust through community, design, and storytelling — proving that solving a deeply local problem thoughtfully can scale globally.","About us":"Other","Solo team":"solo","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"what is","Other":"Social Media"}},{"id":"recEwXmaK7lNmm4L7","createdTime":"2025-10-17T07:32:57.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Antonio","Last name":"Moricca","Email":"moricca.antonio@gmail.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-moricca/","Whatsapp":"https://github.com/antoniomoricca","Skills":"Data Science, AI, Mechanical Engineering, Control System","Problem":"I’d love to explore how AI, especially large language models for interpreting visual data combined with reinforcement learning, can be used to make robots learn and adapt to complex environments.

","Problem":"We have a need to invest in our economy in Europe, but retail investors heavily rely on saving plans.
Generally speaking, consumers don't understand the financial products they subsbribe to, because of their complexity and the small universe of products available at their retail bank. This is changing thanks to platforms like Revolut or TradeRepublic, but that does not mean consumers know what product to choose, why, and how to build a coherent portfolio. Simple risk management guidelines are often missing from their approach.
Drawing a parallel with buying groceries at a grocery store, we fill our baskets with processed food (etfs, funds, etc ...) that we pick from shelves with very poor choice. If we all know that it's healthier on the long run to fill a basket with raw food and cook it ourselves, why don't we do the same with our money ?

Projects like Trend Creator (surfacing emerging social trends) and EduCast (bite-sized AI learning) implemented with Replit helped me learn what resonates with users and uncover friction points.

I spot unmet needs early, monitoring X, Reddit, and Discord for trending topics. For example, noticing a surge in AI learning tools, I iterated EduCast to test the concept and gather real feedback quickly.

I run lean experiments with measurable impact. At Amazon and Vodafone, I built AI systems improving trust, engagement, and conversion for millions of users, skills I now apply to consumer AI prototypes.

With millions of creators globally, AI is the perfect value amplifier, enhancing creativity at scale without replacing it.","⁠⁠First users":"I’d start by going where creators already complain about the problem, niche Discords, Reddit subs, and X threads about writer’s block, editing fatigue, or content overwhelm. Instead of pitching a product, I’d drop small prototypes framed as “creative cheat codes I’m experimenting with, want in?”

Anyone who shows interest wouldn’t get a signup form, they’d get an invite to a private “creator lab” Discord, positioned as early access to raw AI tools before they’re polished. The pitch is simple: “I’ll build features based on your requests, you help shape the co-pilot you wish existed.”

Every time someone gives feedback, I’d turn it into a public win: “X said trimming scripts was painful, so I shipped an instant cut tool overnight.” That combination of transparency + responsiveness builds momentum fast. Once one use case hits, I’d amplify it through mini challenges (e.g. “Make something in 10 minutes with AI, drop results inside”) that naturally get shared with peers. My goal wouldn’t be to acquire 1,000 users, it’d be to create 1,000 collaborators who feel like they discovered something before the crowd.","Favorite startup":"I’d pick early Facebook, not because of what it became, but how it spread.

What fascinates me is how scrappy and narrow it started: one college campus, one use case, “who’s in my network, and how do I connect with them?” It wasn’t trying to be “a social platform for everyone.” It was deep before it was wide.

What made it powerful wasn’t just virality, it was social gravity. Each person who joined increased its value for the next one. It wasn’t distribution through marketing, it was distribution through identity and FOMO. People needed to be part of it because their friends were already inside. That’s the kind of pull I admire, products that don’t just solve a problem, but become a cultural unlock.

The result: careers happen by chance, not by fit.
AI can fix what AI broke. Stop optimizing for volume. Start matching on actual intent - what you're really looking for, where you'd actually thrive. Make hiring about fit, not lottery.

I tend to be very pragmatic at first glance, always looking for solutions that can be applied fast and bring immediate impact. Then, once the initial problem is addressed, I take a step back to adapt and refine the solution to the broader context. It is all about making sure everything connects together and truly serves the bigger picture.

By collecting and analyzing data about their habits, progress, and milestones, we can use AI to personalize the feed and the overall experience. By showing the right content to the right people and helping founders share in a way that feels effortless and relevant.

Beyond content curation, this data opens the door to something much bigger: understanding how people actually build.
AI could identify what drives consistency, motivation, and success, helping us design better tools, improve user experience, and even guide founders with insights about their own journey.
Over time, it’s not just about sharing progress, it’s about learning from it, and using AI to make building in public smarter and more impactful for everyone.","⁠⁠First users":"Step 1: Create a landing page with a waitlist for users to subscribe and collect emails.

Step 3: Once the first version is ready, market a launch on social media and deploy as fast as possible.
Step 4: Every week or every two weeks make changes and organize the marketing campaigns around launches to acquire users in batches.
Step 5: get to a 1 000 users within 3 months with a team of 3 peoples. ","Favorite startup":"My favorite consumer startup success story is Facebook. What I find most impressive is the strategic discipline behind its growth. They started small, made the product work perfectly in one environment, and only then expanded step by step. From the outside it looked fast, but in reality, every move was calculated and controlled. They mastered one layer before moving to the next which is a rare level of precision that built one of the strongest network effects in tech history.

I also admire Mark Zuckerberg as one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. His vision, mindset, and determination are truly inspiring. The idea of “move fast and break things” perfectly reflects the balance between ambition and experimentation: the courage to move quickly while staying grounded in execution and learning.

What I take from Facebook’s story is that execution is everything. Having a good idea is not enough because there are many good ideas out there. The real challenge, and the one most people fail at, is executing perfectly: staying focused, iterating relentlessly, and always being in control of the next step.

It takes approximately 8 to 10 hours per week for a CFO to find data, analyse it take it into consideration before making the right move for the company. 

This is where we come. 

With Sinial, this is done. 
We have create a complete financial cockpit that provide KPI's from all you different sources, and place them in front of your goals of this year, and results of last year.

With no connections, no technical background and no flashy titles as Ex-Something and away of Silicon Valley's hub, she landed investment from Bill Tai because her vision was clear. She wanted Canva to do for design what Google did for search.

","Problem":"AI-Powered Investment Intelligence
Our startup addresses the critical need for data-driven precision in the massive $128 trillion global asset management market, specifically targeting institutional investors like Central Banks, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and Deposit Guarantee Schemes.

The Problem We Solve
Institutional investors currently struggle with fragmented data, opaque benchmarking, and a manual, high-friction process for selecting asset managers. This leads to suboptimal capital allocation, underperformance against peers, and high costs associated with external consultants.

Our Unique Approach
We are building an AI co-pilot that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to solve this.

AI-Powered Benchmarking: We ingest proprietary global institutional investment data to provide real-time, traceable peer-group performance comparisons and deliver hyper-personalized recommendations for optimizing their Investment Policy Statements (IPS).

AI-Driven Matchmaking: We match investors to the most suitable asset managers based on the investor's specific objectives, risk profile, and the manager’s continuous performance metrics, replacing traditional, biased sourcing methods.

The RAG technology ensures our insights are grounded, up-to-date, and fully auditable by linking every recommendation back to its source data, which is essential for regulated institutional clients. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12iz0sZUP0DbXs5cVkpl6EWOVgsZPBADEwXqCG3ujP60/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1","⁠⁠First users":"I have already performed initial market validation and tested interest within a highly relevant subset of the institutional investor segment: Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs).

Proof of Concept & Market Size
Sub-Segment Target: We have focused on Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which are under immense pressure to manage reserves conservatively yet strategically.

Validated Scale: This initial segment alone comprises more than 100 institutions globally with a combined total of over $450 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM).

Key Validation: Our preliminary discussions confirm that these institutions urgently need objective, AI-driven tools for performance benchmarking and unbiased asset manager selection, validating the core problem we are solving.

Unfair Advantage: Industry Network & Access
I possesses a unique, high-trust advantage due to deep involvement in the deposit insurance industry:

Network Access: I am an active member of the leading international and regional forums for this industry: the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI).
This involvement provides a pre-built network and established credibility with the very decision-makers (CEOs, CFOs, and Investment Committee heads) we need to onboard. This dramatically speeds up the typical sales cycle and lowers customer acquisition costs within this highly conservative, trust-dependent market.","Favorite startup":"My favorite startup success story is LlamaIndex.

More and more burnouts, Generation Z that no longer wants to work, strikes, and political crises all lead to lower reproduction rates.
At this speed humanity will be extinct in less than a decade. We don't have to fear AI taking over, as humanity will not reach that point.
Work and our work culture are at the basis of all of this. The pressure of always \"being on\" + social media + striving for a good income + a successful career + a good reputation can be overwhelming and exhausting.

The solution can be found in AI, especially if we can reach AGI and AI can take over large parts of the boring, non-productive work.

The first step is like what Sam Altman introduced to us as \"the one person unicorn\".

But our ambition is even bigger, what if we build 0 person unicorns?

At Autonomous, we call them Fully Autonomous Ventures, companies invented, created, and operated purely by AI.

It is no longer science-fiction -> we are training a foundational DRL-HF model that will build and operate 100.000 startups by 2030.

And we're right on the other side of Station F, in the landing zone, looking for a good program to join. We now believe it can be this Pioneers AI lab that opens the network we need.

Want a demo or a coffee? Find us at table 050 in create zone.","⁠⁠First users":"We're training a Neural network (AI) on Google ads, sponsored by the Flemish government.
Here is the reasoning behind it, backed by a personal meeting with Michael Siebel when he was the CEO of Y-combinator:

Marketing exists out of the right message (1) shown to the right people (2).

1. The right message -> 99% of the marketers get this wrong:
Most messages are either converting (e.g., Buy our product) OR viral (e.g., Gangnam style dance at Station F). But almost none of them have them both.
That's why we believe in just \"buying\" the viral component -> advertising. You no longer have to wonder about the traction; you just buy traction.
You only have to focus on the message to let people convert (not about going viral).
We wanted to train a model on organic content and \"hack\" growth, but Michael told us that it's paid that let the world goes around (and that major portals love rather as organic).

2. Who is actually the right audience?
Humans tend to believe to know who their ideal customers are. But these are all assumptions.
What if we had a Deep Reinforcement Learning model within Advertising that automatically shows your ads to 1000 people, iterates by the minute, and that learns the ideal customer?
No more \"assumptions\" or \"guesswork\", pure mathematics.

-> One example insight from this: by 70% of the month (+-21st), most advertising campaigns will run out of money (max budget), so the CAC drops and the ROI sky rockets.","Favorite startup":"ChatGPT, for 3 reasons:

1. OpenAI did not invent LLMs. LLMs were invented at Google. Yet Google decided not to pursue it because training such an AI to prove that \"attention is all you need\" and \"more data = better AI\" wasn't worth it. So Sam Altman called a few friends, raised a couple tens of millions, and \"bet\" that this would be a generational technology... it was nothing more as a bet.

2. The fun fact? It wasn't that successful. We saw demos when LLMs only created garbage text. We even did a roadshow at several big companies, showcasing that this technology would change our world forever, but no one believed us, we were even laughed at in boardrooms... Until OpenAI putted everything in a chat interface and overnight it became the most viral product ever created.

3. Sam Altman (as the ex-CEO of YC and the personal protegé of Paul Graham) knew the exact playbook to build a unicorn. It was even documented within the ranks of Y-combinator. Yes, they did not follow it with OpenAI. They did the exact opposite, throwing away all the lessons and learnings... this gives us the insight that no matter what, nothing is fixed. The only thing we can do is have a deep reinforcement learning model \"learning\" every individual situation and adapting by the hour.

The lessons:
1. You don't have to invent the wheel yourself; you just have to believe in things other people don't
2. It's not what you build but how you present it (it is better to have a shitty product with good marketing than a good product with shitty marketing)
3. The world goes so fast that by the time you have learned something, your experience is already outdated. Only those who continue to learn will survive.

AI could help capture and express these wishes, turning a difficult topic into something peaceful, guided, and shared within families before it’s too late.","⁠⁠First users":"I’d start with a small, emotionally resonant niche — people who care about preserving memories or identity online.

I want to solve the critical problem of brand invisibility in the post-search era. My goal is to help companies master their “Share of Model” (their share of voice inside AI models) so they are cited as the reference answer, instead of being replaced by a competitor or a generic reply.

The problem: silent traffic loss
We are shifting from “Search” (scan links) to “Ask” (get an instant answer). If Google AI, ChatGPT or Perplexity don’t “know” a brand or can’t interpret its data, it simply disappears for the user at the decisive moment. This is not just fewer SEO clicks; it is vanishing from consideration.

The urgency
LLMs are building a kind of long-term memory. Brands that don’t make their content easy to ingest today will let competitors become the default source for years.

The solution: a GEO platform (Generative Engine Optimization)
Not just pleasing a ranking algorithm, but becoming intelligible and trustworthy for language models.
1 - Measurement (Share of Model): one score that quantifies how often your brand is cited on key topics vs competitors across major models and answer engines (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity).
2 - Semantic diagnosis: find why AI ignores you. Missing citations? Unstructured data (no Schema.org)? Content too hard to summarize reliably?
3 - LLM-ready optimization: generate “knowledge capsules” compact blocks (facts, numbers, definitions, comparison tables) formatted so models can extract and reuse them verbatim in answers.","⁠⁠First users":"If I launched a consumer AI product tomorrow, I’d get my first 1,000 users with a “show, don’t tell” plan built on large-scale, permissionless audits.

1 - Proof before product (weeks 1–2)
I build an internal testing engine. I target 5,000 sites (SaaS, e-commerce, media). For each, I extract 5 strategic keywords and query answer engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google SGE/Gemini) to see who they cite. I store results (screenshots and logs): on their own queries, the AI recommends a competitor. This gives me a brand-by-brand evidence base.

2 - High-precision cold outreach (~300 users)
I email decision makers (Head of SEO/CMO) 1:1. Subject: “AI recommends [Competitor] for [their main keyword].” Body: short note + screenshot + link to a free mini-report with fixes. Because the pain is proven, I expect 10–15% conversion on this ultra-qualified list.

3 - Viral Hall of Fame/Shame (~400 users)
I publish an “AI Visibility Index” by sector (brands cited vs. ignored). Winners share it; others sign up to improve their ranking. I distribute via LinkedIn (tagging), SEO/marketing communities, and trade press that loves exclusive data.

4 - Self-serve lead magnet (~300 users)
On the homepage: “Enter your URL + 1 keyword to see if AI names you.” Instant score (e.g., 12/100 = high risk). To see the full diagnosis and recommendations, users create a free account (freemium). This becomes the long-term organic channel.

Why this works : 
I don’t ask people to trust a promise; I show the current loss (not being named by AI) and the path to fix it. Combined impact: ~300 (outreach) + ~400 (index) + ~300 (lead magnet) ≈ 1,000 motivated users who already understand the value before signing up.","Favorite startup":"Without any hesitation, my favorite success story is Le Petit Ballon. It's not just a business story; it's the story of an idea that solved a near-universal anxiety: the fear of choosing the wrong bottle of wine.

What I find absolutely brilliant about their approach is that they understood the real problem wasn't access to wine, but the intimidation it creates. For millions of people, standing in front of a supermarket aisle is a source of stress. You want to make a good choice, but you don't know where to start, so you end up grabbing the same safe bottle every time. Le Petit Ballon saw this emotional friction and transformed it into a moment of pure delight.

Their solution, a subscription box with two bottles selected by a top sommelier, is a stroke of genius. It acts as a shortcut to confidence. You no longer have to choose; you get to discover. The subscription model isn't just smart for revenue; it's perfect for creating a ritual. Every month, it's an expected surprise, a gift you give to yourself. This excellence in execution allowed them to build a huge and loyal community, growing to over 150,000 subscribers. That's not just a number; it represents hundreds of thousands of people who stopped feeling anxious in the wine aisle.

Beyond the business model, I love how they transformed a simple purchase into a genuine learning experience. With their tasting cards and magazine, they made the world of wine fun and accessible, without ever being snobbish. It's a quiet revolution in a world that can often be very traditional and closed-off.

For me, Le Petit Ballon is the perfect example of a startup that succeeded by bringing joy and making a complex world feel incredibly simple and human.","About us":"linkedin","Solo team":"solo","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"Yes"}},{"id":"recVHbHkLzUEg3RVr","createdTime":"2025-11-11T10:34:51.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Walid","Last name":"Fezza","Email":"walfezza@gmail.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/walid-fezza-40588410b/","Whatsapp":"+33 6 18 55 38 72","Skills":"Business, Finance, Marketing and more recently I have developed basic skills in: N8N, React Native, Supabase...","Problem":"I would like to solve the problem of the \"souvenir\".

How they ended up living in the city where my father was born? What jobs did they have when they were young? How did their appartments look like?

There is a famous saying that says: \"You die twice: first, when life leaves your body, second, when you are forgotten\".

I would like to create a tool using AI that would help you create a long standing history that will remain long after you die. 

A tool where the user could journal, add pictures, answer random questions that are pushed by the app. The user would also have tracked location. At the end, after many many years of journaling, picture entry and location tracking. The AI tool would write a biography of the user (pdf or book)

The user could then keep it and give this children whenever he sees fit and ensure this his story, thoughts, secrets and life lessons will never be forgotten by his children, grand children and all the descendants.","⁠⁠First users":"Many vectors can be used but I believe that for the first 1,000 users I would go to:

- Reddit communities: many threads usually exists especially for consumer products - communities in reddit can be very powerful
- Events: Salons, events, foires - Many events can be attended to talk about the product and ask for users
- Friends & Family: pushing the idea to F&F to test and ask them to talk around them about the product 
- Alumni network: Using the alumni network of the business school to talk about the product and get first users

I believe these 4 vectors could get the first 1,000 users without paying in ads.","Favorite startup":"Strava because they understood that consumer are tired of traditional social media.

Today, social media have either become content providers (Instagram Reels, Tiktok) or Peer 2 Peer social media (Whatsapp, Snap, Telegram). The \"home\" or \"feed\" page of traditional Facebook is something burried in the stone age and people don't use it anymore.

Strava built an exciting home page where you actually want to scroll by using simple methods: 
- Purified design
- No ads
- Post from your friends only
- No random content from influencer

Due to the company’s small size, I had the opportunity to take on both strategic and operational roles, which allowed me to develop a wide range of skills including interpersonal, commercial, analytical, strategic and communication abilities.

Following this experience, I decided to join emlyon business school’s Grande École program, where I had the opportunity to complete internships in investment and strategy. These roles strengthened my rigor, autonomy, analytical thinking and critical mindset.

In my current internship at the family office Cap Investissement, we work with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and implement close operational follow-up with the companies we support. Moreover, at emlyon, my team and I developed a group entrepreneurial project that ranked among the best in our cohort and led us to compete in the Rhône-Alpes entrepreneurship contest.","Problem":"Recently, I noticed that several companies in Cap Investissement’s portfolio were increasingly seeking solutions to improve their visibility on conversational AIs as part of their SEA/SEO strategies. With the rapid development of AI, this strategic area has become a crucial challenge for companies aiming to enhance their online presence.

This observation led me to conduct a series of tests to determine to what extent a company’s name could rank better than another on large language models (LLMs). I selected a sample of companies with similar characteristics and asked the same set of questions across four conversational AIs to identify the factors that influence their visibility on these models. I then compiled my observations into Excel spreadsheets for analysis.

For now, I haven’t yet acted on these findings, as my current internship is quite demanding and I am also working on my master’s thesis. However, in the near future, I would like to build on this approach by continuing my experiments and eventually developing an AI-powered automated solution that could help companies improve their visibility on LLMs.","⁠⁠First users":"The acquisition strategy focuses on clarity, focus and execution. The goal is to spark curiosity and drive engagement by asking one simple question: “Are you visible on ChatGPT?” This hook highlights a fast-growing challenge in brand visibility on conversational AIs and positions the project as one of the first real solutions in this space.

LinkedIn will serve as the main growth channel through data-driven posts, benchmarks and short insights that invite professionals to test their “AI visibility score” for free. A targeted outreach campaign will complement this approach, reaching marketing and SEO leaders with personalized reports on their brand’s performance across conversational AIs. This hands-on strategy is designed to generate strong engagement and rapid adoption.

Partnerships with SEO agencies, marketing freelancers and innovation programs such as Pioneers AI Lab will amplify credibility and reach. The project will also launch on Product Hunt, Reddit and Indie Hackers to attract early adopters and collect user feedback.

The user experience will focus on a fast and interactive test that provides instant results. This simple yet powerful interaction encourages sharing, builds trust and drives viral growth.

I bring a holistic understanding of complex systems—from code to production—through design, simulation, and strategic execution.

Development & DevOps Expertise

   - Proficient in Python (for scripting, automation, and data analysis) and Ruby on Rails for web development.
   - Hands-on experience with modern frameworks and tools: React, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Vite, and more.
   - Solid DevOps foundation: deploying apps on Digital Ocean, managing self-hosted services, and maintaining personal server infrastructure.
   - Self-driven learner: I continuously expand my skills through hands-on experimentation and technical exploration.

Project Management & Cross-functional 

   - Skilled in building strategic roadmaps, managing resources, and leading cross-functional projects.
   - Able to coordinate diverse teams and drive complex initiatives from concept to delivery.

Industrial Engineering & Innovation
   - Contributed to major aerospace programs, including:
   - The LEAP Engine Certification project at Safran.
   - The launch of a next-generation Additive Manufacturing Plant, integrating AI, advanced research, and automated production.
   - End-to-end engineering capabilities:
   - Mechanical design, numerical simulation (thermal, fluid, structural), testing, and production optimization.
","Problem":"Having worked on complex industrial programs like the Safran LEAP Engine Certification and the launch of an AI-driven Additive Manufacturing Plant, I’ve seen firsthand how high-impact research thrives in small, agile teams. These teams move fast, iterate boldly, and deliver innovative results—but as projects scale, coordination overhead grows exponentially.

In large organizations, researchers often juggle multiple roles—technical contributor, communicator, planner—which dilutes their focus and slows progress. A significant portion of time is spent writing documentation, reporting outcomes, and aligning with broader roadmaps, rather than pushing the boundaries of innovation

I believe we can build a project management system tailored for technical research environments—a connective layer that empowers small teams to stay focused while seamlessly interfacing with product managers and organizational leadership. This system would act as a strategic \"middle layer,\" reducing noise, surfacing key insights, and enabling better decision-making without adding friction.

Such a tool would not only enhance productivity but also unlock greater exploration and creativity—allowing teams to do more with the same resources. In highly technical domains, this kind of infrastructure could be transformative.","⁠⁠First users":"While I haven’t yet launched a product that reached 1,000 users, my perspective is shaped by what I’ve observed and experienced in the field. Here’s what I believe matters most when building a tool for technical teams:

- Build in public – Open-sourcing from day one fosters transparency, trust, and community-driven momentum.
- Minimize technical friction – Installation and deployment should be effortless, so teams can focus on using the tool, not fighting it.
- Cultivate deep relationships – Partner closely with a handful of dedicated labs or research teams. Make them love the product, and they’ll become its strongest advocates.
- Craft a magical UI – The interface should feel intuitive, elegant, and empowering—like it was designed just for them.

Ultimately, I believe highly technical projects benefit from tools that act as quiet enablers—reducing complexity, amplifying focus, and unlocking creativity without demanding more resources. That’s the kind of product I want to help build.
","Favorite startup":"One example that immediately comes to mind is Telegram. Setting aside ethical concerns and other controversies, it’s remarkable how they’ve built such a massively successful app with a relatively small team—reportedly between 30 and 50 people. Their ability to scale globally while maintaining speed and product quality is a testament to what lean, focused teams can achieve when empowered by the right vision and tools.
It reinforces my belief that small, agile teams—when supported by smart infrastructure—can outperform much larger organizations. The key is to reduce friction, streamline communication, and let builders focus on what they do best.

I created Paris’s biggest comedy festival, which inspired a famous French TV show.
Later, I built one of the first addictive fashion photo apps (2011–2012).
Instagram got the $1B deal with Facebook. I got the experience.

I’ve built teams, written, performed in, and directed over 100 videos.
I’ve created TV series and written the first scripts.

Today, I use LLMs, Google’s AI ecosystem (Notebook LM, Gemini AI Studio), n8n, Webflow —
and whatever tomorrow’s smartest tool will be.
I don’t follow trends — I start them. What else, George? ☕","Problem":"Millions of people love gardening — they buy plants, grow their own fruits and vegetables, and dream of living more sustainably.
But most of them are frustrated: they spend hours searching for reliable, personalized information, often wasting time, money, and even their plants — which can be quite costly.

The gardening world hasn’t truly modernized. It’s still far from leveraging the real power of AI.
Some apps, like PlantNet, offer useful tools but only cover a small part of what gardeners actually need.

In France alone, gardening represents an $8 billion annual market (2024) — and it’s growing fast.
Over 20 million people are directly concerned, and 28% of households maintain a vegetable garden.

Our goal is to bring AI into every gardener’s hands — making organic gardening smarter, simpler, and more accessible than ever.
We’ll start in France, expand to the US, and then scale worldwide.","⁠⁠First users":"I have a \"$100M offer\": Free 1-hour/month vocal chat with our AI gardener — FOR LIFE!

Camille bridges art and science through her background at École Polytechnique and PSL. As Head of the Economic Department at the French Embassy, she connects people, institutions, and companies — bringing strategic and cross-cultural expertise to the team.

Together, we combine technical excellence, product intuition, and cultural empathy — an AI-native team ready to make curiosity contagious.","Problem":"Today, ~27% of Orsay visitors buy guidance (20% audioguides at €6, 7% tours at €26), yet that small slice already drives ~11M€/year. The issue isn’t willingness to pay—it’s reach and convenience: queues, rented devices, fixed routes, and limited tour capacity mean 73% get nothing. 

Regart, our AI pocket guide runs on visitor's phones, turns each artwork into a conversation with a simple scan. Visitors can chat with the art itself — asking questions, uncovering hidden stories, interests they didn't even know they had. We convert the unserved into paying users, share revenue with museums, and cut device/staff costs while returning visit insights.”","⁠⁠First users":"We’d start with a 30-day pilot at the Musée d’Orsay, one of the world’s most visited museums (≈10,000 visitors/day).  
By placing RegArt QR codes at key entry points and artworks, even a 1% conversion rate would generate ≈3,000 downloads in one month.  
Assuming 30% retention, we’d reach our first 1,000 active users — directly on-site.

The pilot would validate both our B2C traction and B2B model: museums benefit from reduced hardware costs and higher visitor engagement, while visitors get an interactive, AI-powered guide at a fraction of the price of a traditional audio-guide/guided tour.

Beyond the pilot, our growth strategy focuses on shareability and community. 
RegArt lets users save, comment on, and share their favorite artworks. This organic sharing turns art discovery into a social experience, driving virality beyond museum walls.","Favorite startup":"Our favorite success story is Spotify — a company that reinvented how people connect with culture through personalization and discovery.  
Launched in 2008 to just 10,000 beta users, Spotify scaled to over 500 million users and 240 million subscribers across 180+ markets by 2025.  
Its success came from AI-powered recommendations (like Discover Weekly), which made users listen twice as much, and from a brilliant free-to-premium funnel that converted curiosity into loyalty.

That story mirrors RegArt.  
We aim to do for art what Spotify did for music: make cultural exploration personal, dynamic, and accessible.  
Where Spotify builds playlists to help users rediscover sound, RegArt builds art “playlists” — curated journeys linking artworks, styles, and emotions.","About us":"Email","Solo team":"team","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"Yes","Notes":"0","Yes/No - Feedback":"YES/ very tech team/ one cofounder was in the YC with his startup, then pivoted and left the project due to/ 4-cofounders from middle school together","Maxime Comments":"5/10 - Interesting team but bad market...

Yet that’s exactly what slows down so many startups, great teams, scattered across continents, constantly losing momentum between workdays. With Fluxion, I want to change that. It’s an AI-driven system built around a 24-hour follow-the-sun model, where developer teams hand off progress seamlessly as the world turns.

It’s not just another productivity tool, it’s a way to keep the lights on for startups 24/7. I’d tell that story across founder and developer communities, from Product Hunt and IndieHackers to early-stage incubators and AI Slack groups. The message would be simple: you don’t loose time, you use it differently. Early access would be invite-only, bringing in teams eager to test how far continuous collaboration can take them. The first 1,000 wouldn’t just be users, they’d be early believers in a new rhythm of work, one that never pauses for sleep.","Favorite startup":"Linear
Because it turned something as dry as task management into something that actually feels good to use. Linear didn’t just build a faster Jira, it built flow. Every click feels intentional, every design choice pushes you forward. It’s the kind of product that reminds you that speed and calm can coexist. As someone who comes from a copywriting background, I love when a product speaks without words, when its interface tells the story. That’s what Linear nailed. And that’s the energy I want to carry into Fluxion.

When first becoming parents, you are thrown into a world of unknowns. The first comes with taking care of the essentials: sleeping, eating and overall health that have been tackled through great success consumer apps (ex: Baby Tracker). The second is \"What now\"? Once these essentials are met, what should I, as a parent, do to help my child grow? Parents faced with this anxiety can only find complex scientific papers or low trust worthy articles that are not adapted to the child's age or development stage. 
How could we solve the problem?
AI curated feed: delivers daily digestible, personalised insights based on a child’s exact age and development stage. Replaces the stressful late-night searches by a calm read of relevant and reassuring information
AI activity planner: proposes simple, high-impact activities to support different developmental stages and tailored to a family's schedule. For example, it could suggest three different ways to  build hand-eye coordination, using only items a parent already has at home.
The power of AI here is its ability to personalise at scale, learning what activities a parent and child enjoy to make future suggestions even better. The goal is to reassure parents so they can fully focus on enjoying moments with their newborn","⁠⁠First users":"I would have a multi-step approach: 
1. Create a simple, free hook: vide-coded web-app such as an AI activity generator where parents fill out a form and receive a list of activities to do. 
2. Community based marketing:
- Jump into subreddits, blogs, discords, instagram comment sections that people already use to get information about their baby's development
- Partner with gatekeepers: try and build relationships with pediatrists and offer them and clients free access in exchange for expert feedback
- micro-influencers: partner with nich micro-influencers specialized in child development and offer them free access and walkthrough in exchange for review
3. Once the first consumers hooked, I'd creaet a community flywheel: build a WhatsApp / Discord group so users can share tips, advice, feedback. Users should genuinely love the product and feel like they are part of an exclusive group of co-creators of the solution so they act as micro-influencers with their close network.","Favorite startup":"I love how Discord emerged. 
First because it has experienced the ideal playbook: solving a very niche problem (helping gamers talk to each other with very low-latency VoIP) to gradually become an all-purpose platform. 
Second because of the way they first grew: very limited marketing as they focused on deliverying a very efficient problem, convinced such a community-heavy industry such as gamers would lead a profound word of mouth effect driving thousands and soon millions of users if they fell in love with the product
Third, because of the how they pivoted: product teams noticed hundreds of servers were created for non-gaming topics. These \"hacks\" led to repositioning the company as a generalist. Instead of fighting these users, listening to them closely proved key. \"Hackers\" of one's platform are often showing what you to build instead of what you originally built.","About us":"linkedin","Solo team":"solo","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"Yes","Notes":"?"}},{"id":"recu9t9pYx7cDMiS6","createdTime":"2025-10-17T07:32:57.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Muhammed Safiul","Last name":"Azam","Email":"muhammed.safiul.azam@gmail.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammedsafiulazam/","Skills":"Developer","Problem":"Recruiting or may be Accounting.","⁠⁠First users":"Developer","Solo team":"Solo","Availability":"Yes","Apply accelerator":"I don't know","Notes":"0"}},{"id":"recub8izIxe0z1VlH","createdTime":"2025-10-17T08:21:02.000Z","fields":{"First name":"Ginevra","Last name":"Fisogni","Email":"ginevra.fisogni@gmail.com","Linkedln":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginevrafisogni/","Whatsapp":"+330754189993","Skills":"Product & Strategy

AI can empower instant triage, diagnosis, and connection to the right care at the right time.","⁠⁠First users":"Depends on the audience—but I’d start by activating my INSEAD and professional network, building early credibility through trust. Then, I’d pair it with targeted social content and community storytelling to spark organic pull.","Favorite startup":"Cult.fit from India. They turned fitness into a social movement—making healthy living addictive, not obligatory. While most apps compete for attention, Cult.fit built genuine habit loops that improve users’ physical and mental health.

I also handle the strategic aspects of community growth and user interviews to iterate quickly. I always work the same way: gathering data by talking to users, observing what’s being done elsewhere, quickly designing a solution, iterating, and repeating the process.","Problem":"I want to address the problem of the lack of opportunities when starting a business. Hardworking entrepreneurs who execute well should gain faster access to peers and contacts who can help them move forward. Too many superficial projects are put in the spotlight, which is not good for the overall development of the ecosystem and global innovation. We need to focus resources on real founder's potential.","⁠⁠First users":"To reach the first 1,000 users, I will first gain a precise understanding of my problem by engaging with online entrepreneur communities like Reddit and Discord. I then create a landing page for sign-ups. Once the problem is clear, I produce TikTok Shorts that I distribute across multiple accounts and iterate quickly. I also communicate on LinkedIn and YouTube through personal branding, subtly showcasing use cases of my product.","Favorite startup":"My favorite consumer app story is Zenly. It’s one of the few French startups that went all the way to acquisition and had the ambition of putting the map on the phone’s home screen.

Strong background in e-commerce, Web3, and agentic systems.
Experience in prototyping, user research, go-to-market, and content-driven distribution.
Comfortable working in ambiguity, setting clear priorities, and shipping under tight constraints.","Problem":"I want to solve the problem of humans having to manually execute obvious commerce actions after customer intent already exists.

Today, 60–70% of carts are abandoned, not because of lack of demand, but because follow-ups, checkouts, and decisions still depend on manual workflows and fragmented tools.

With agentic AI, my goal is to build systems where AI agents autonomously execute these actions — cart recovery, checkout, follow-ups, and customer interactions — while humans remain in the loop to supervise, validate, and steer outcomes.","⁠⁠First users":"I would start with organic, content-driven distribution.

I already create short-form content consistently (LinkedIn, short videos), and I would double down on it by targeting a very specific micro-segment with a clear pain point. The goal wouldn’t be virality, but relevance.

I’d publish daily short-form content showing real use cases, demos, and before/after scenarios, driving traffic to a simple landing page with early access.
In parallel, I’d engage directly in comments, DMs, and niche communities to convert attention into users.

Once the first cohort is active, I’d leverage feedback loops and social proof to expand to adjacent segments.","Favorite startup":"My favorite consumer startup story is WhatsApp.

It succeeded by removing friction rather than adding features: simple onboarding, instant value, and extremely high engagement. It became infrastructure without feeling like software.

This inspires how I think about AI products — the best ones disappear into usage, feel natural, and solve a real problem with minimal cognitive load.","About us":"Community/Alumni","⁠⁠Refer":"I would recommend highly execution-driven builders I’ve met through hackathons and the AI startup ecosystem.","Solo team":"solo","Availability":"yes","Apply accelerator":"Yes","Other":"One Person Unicorn hackathon at Station F"}}],"offset":"itrGPODbXz4P2es71/recwv07jR0Ll9FfRZ"}
