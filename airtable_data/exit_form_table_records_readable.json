      "What are your next steps?": "- I should have started fresh (instead of keeping in mind my project or Oudavone's as is) almost back from scratch in order to benefit the most from the program\n- Tech is mostly mature (or at least went back to more \"normal\" levels) and VCs might have a lesser impact than before in the space\n- Importance of networking",
      "What are your top 3 biggest learnings?": "First, everything I'm going to talk about is not simple to get right, just want to provide helpful feedback:\n\n- Participants are quite varied in their backgrounds/experience on super early/early stage companies, I feel like some could be paired with more early stage veterans during the first few weeks maybe?\n- There is a lot of content in the first few weeks that feels great and engaging, then a pretty hard stop in rhythm. When I came back from holidays, there was a clear rift between the few teams already formed and the rest of the batch felt aimless. Possible solutions: More handholding for matching people together, a coach that spends at least an hour a week with each group to guide them...\n- More precise communication on what the team wants from each stages. Examples: \nMost of us did not really understand the point of Friday pitches, we all felt they were supposed to be there to show progress, but since we had guests almost each time, it ended up just being pitches without having time to pitch properly. \nSome projects were obviously non VC backable from scratch, I think you should be more upfront about that as well and tell people that they should switch ideas if they want to be VC backed. \n\nAll of those points depend on the general philosophy as well, if you want a more \"sink or swim\" 2 months, most of them don't need to be addressed, it's a valid strategy to prove who has the grit to be an entrepreneur and who hasn't, but might leave introvert devs in the dirt even though they have tech skills to offer.",

I got no comments or feedback about my weekly update.\n\nThe weekly themes were exciting in the beginning but when we pivoted it didn't make sense to follow the them.
