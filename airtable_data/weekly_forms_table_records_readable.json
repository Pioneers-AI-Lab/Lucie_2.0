      "What are your top 1-3 goals for next week ?": "1. Large well established public sector sales teams have dedicated Account Executives for different regions and verticals. They are rather hesitant to talk about internal processes but they confirmed that processes we plan to automate on large scale are processed manually (eg. getting contract duration from awards notices).\n2. Several users are paying agencies to monitor tenders. They are supposed to notify them about upcoming opportunities/ tenders.\n3. Segmentation is key. As conditions for teams differ, focus on a sub segment with highest needs can allow moving faster. Currently assumed sweet spot: Companies with dedicated sales resources for public sector but not yet super established, e.g. international tech company or SMEs. ",
      "What have you learned from your users ?": "User Interviews beyond network.
