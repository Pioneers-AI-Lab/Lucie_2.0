Applicants are typically required to provide identification and proof of income, with identity verification sometimes completed through a small bank transfer or mobile signature. Based on this assessment, the bank determines creditworthiness and offers a personalized interest rate reflecting the applicant’s financial position. Most loans do not require collateral or guarantors, but stable income and a reasonable debt-to-income ratio are generally expected.
