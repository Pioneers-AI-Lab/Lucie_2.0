My journey started early: I wrote my first lines of C++ at 8, and by 11, I was interning at my first startup — debugging, shipping, and falling in love with building. That love never left.\n\nOver the years, I’ve built and scaled products and tech teams from scratch, wearing every startup hat — from writing backend code to pitching investors. I’m a technical founder at heart, with deep expertise in distributed systems and high-throughput platforms. I can code 0 to 1, and scale processes and teams from 1 to 100.\n\nI have a hustler–builder bias. While I’ve done pre-sales, led teams, shipped code, hired and fired, and handled operations, tech, and business strategy - I am at my best building products. I believe in fast iterations, staying uncomfortable, and surrounding myself with people who raise the bar.\n\nPS:\nWhile I have led and can do web app development, understand and build mobile apps - my current strengths are in building data platforms, web services (backend), infra setup and automation, designing scalable architectures and multiple clouds. \n\nI am very impact driven. I plan to aim high, build something of value for others while generating value for myself. I have had the most joy when others tell me they love what I have built and this motivates me.",

I have a strong foundation in robotics perception, motion planning, and infrastructure development.
